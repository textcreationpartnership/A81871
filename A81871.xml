            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>My deſire for you is,</hi> That of thoſe whom Chriſt hath committed to me, I may looſe none; but that at the Great day I may ſay; <hi>Here am I, and the Sheepe thou haſt committed to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               </hi> Have alwayes thought, (and still doe) that there are two ſorts of People whom wee ought to eye in all our Preaching, viz. <hi>deſperate ſinners,</hi> and <hi>deſpairing Saints;</hi> the former need <hi>Coraſives,</hi> the latter <hi>Cordials.</hi> It is, and ſhould be our worke, and wiſdome, to endeavour the <hi>humbling of the one,</hi> and the <hi>heightening of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> The firſt are to be made to

               <hi>know their tranſgreſſions,</hi> the ſecond are to be <hi>told of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And with reference to both theſe, Christ hath furniſhed us with <hi>convicting,</hi> and <hi>comforting gifts</hi> and <hi>grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the ſecond ſort which I eyed in the Preaching, and printing of theſe enſuing Notes, and if thou be of this ſort, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not need to invite thee to <hi>read,</hi> but rather beſeech thee to <hi>beleeve,</hi> that all the comforts which are in Chriſt are for thee; for to this end he was <hi>annoynted,</hi> that he might <hi>proclaime the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of peace, pardon, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, acceptance, &amp;c.</hi> to ſuch as thou art.</p>
            <p>If thou be of the firſt ſort, viz. <hi>A deſperate preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> I ſay to thee, <hi>Hands off,</hi> as yet thou haſt <hi>no part in the
<pb facs="tcp:120075:10"/>comforts of God.</hi> Chriſt will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make thee (in a meaſure) know <hi>what ſorrow meanes,</hi> if he intend thee <hi>joy.</hi> Thou wilt be <hi>dejected</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art <hi>exalted,</hi> and ſurely couldeſt thou but ſee thy ſtate (whilſt a preſumptuous ſinner) thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest cry out, <hi>What ſhall I doe to be ſaved?</hi> But hoping better things of thee, and ſuch as accompany ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I ſhall acquaint thee only with foure things about this enſuing tract.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>That it is the ſubſtance of many Sermons,</hi> and that when it was preached, it was by much, more then now it is. Yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>That the abatement in the printing, from what it was in preaching, is not materiall.</hi> Things are here in <hi>briefe,</hi> which then were more <hi>largely</hi> opened;
<pb facs="tcp:120075:11"/>and I preſume, thy <hi>eye</hi> will reape as much by a little, which is stil before thee to looke upon; as thine <hi>Eare</hi> can by a great deale more, which (though it be longer, and larger in the receiving of, yet) is quickly paſſed by and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>The ſubject treates with dejected ſoules, to whom the ſweeteſt words of freeſt Grace are little enough;</hi> And therefore if thou thinke ſome paſſages tend to a <hi>preſumption (though none I know of are ſo)</hi> remember de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſoules are farre enough from that, being more ready to <hi>deſpaire</hi> then to <hi>hope,</hi> notwithſtanding the cleareſt diſcoveries of Chriſts love and ſweetneſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>The whole was at firſt intended for, and delivered to
<pb facs="tcp:120075:11"/>a particular Congregation in a private way;</hi> And had not they ſealed to it, as to the truth of Chriſt, it had been <hi>buried</hi> in the <hi>darke,</hi> and never come to this <hi>publick light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have onely two Requeſts to make to thee, and I have done with thee.</p>
            <p>My Firſt Requeſt is this, <hi>That thou bee not haſty in reading;</hi> But that thou meditate on what is tendred. <hi>The Bee which onely lights upon a flower, gathers no hony:</hi> Its her abiding a while, that ſuckes out the <hi>ſweete.</hi> Such Readers get but a little, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>runne</hi> over, then <hi>read</hi> a <hi>Booke.</hi> And that perſon will finde but little ſweetneſse in a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall,</hi> who onely holds it a little while in his mouth. Its <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:120075:12"/>which renders truths ſweet. I have indeavoured to write much in a little; and I dare humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that if thou wilt but weigh and conſider ſeriouſly; what I ſay to any Head, thou wilt finde a great deale more matter then words. Its true, I have not, handled things ſo largely as I might; but yet I have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested what might bee ſufficient to my purpoſe, which is, not ſo much to <hi>convince the diſpute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heads,</hi> as to <hi>comfort the dejected Hearts of Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore is my firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that thou meditate on what thou readeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My next Requeſt is this, That if in any part</hi> (or in the whole) <hi>thy attainment be above what is here offered,
<pb facs="tcp:120075:12"/>that thou doe not ſlight it altogether upon that account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even <hi>David himſelfe</hi> was ſometimes <hi>aloft,</hi> and never thought of thoſe <hi>dejections,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which hee afterwards groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And peradventure, though now thou <hi>keepe holy day,</hi> and <hi>feaſt</hi> with Chriſt, in full aſſurance: A <hi>day</hi> or <hi>houre of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may come,</hi> in which thou mayeſt bee glad of a <hi>crumme of comfort;</hi> And then this poore tracte may bee of ſome uſe to thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>In the interim <hi>pittie</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for thoſe who either are in, or lyable to a <hi>dejected ſtate,</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>counſell</hi> too.</p>

               <p>And in truth, this will ſtand very fit with the former: <hi>David</hi> tells his ſoule, <hi>he ſhould yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſingly praiſe Gods ſalvations, which he ſhewed to him.</hi> Yea, and that he ſhould confeſſe him to be

               </p>
               <p>So that now put altogether, and it amounts to thus much; as if <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>What art thou caſt down O my ſoule? How ſtrangely is it? In what way is it?

               <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe tis here ſet out ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler then there, (though happily few mind it) this laſt is (as it were) <hi>a ſecond Edition with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> for there are two additions in this verſe unto that.</p>

               <p>And <hi>David was not ſingle:</hi> His caſe was but as others have beene. <hi>Job</hi> was dejected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; his ſoule was <hi>caſt downe,</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>with a witneſſe,</hi> when he <hi>rent his mantle, and ſhaved his head, and fell down upon the ground,</hi> (as tis, Job 1.20.) he was much diſquieted: And as <hi>Job</hi> went before, ſo <hi>Hezekiah</hi> came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>David,</hi> in ſoule dejection.

               <p>I need not tell you of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> or of <hi>Heman:</hi> Surely you have heard of their dejections, and diſquiets.

                     </item>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing which I ſhall ſpeake unto is, the <hi>nature of ſoule dejections:</hi> Now this, I ſhall be but breife in.</p>
               <p>Spirituall dejection, or ſoul-caſting downe may eaſily bee gueſſed at, if you conſider ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p>On the one hand (<hi>viz.</hi> the right) <hi>That the ſoule hath ſome ſweet, and ſpirituall injoyments; in the injoyment of which it is much lifted up?</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy puts the ſoule upon the <hi>Wing,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as it were a <hi>mounting</hi> upward. <hi>David</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>kept holy day</hi> (as tis verſ. 4. of this Pſalme) in that day hee ſang no <hi>Pſalme,</hi> but ſuch as was <hi>ſweet.</hi> Still hee ſpake with the voice of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>praiſe.</hi> But now conſider againe,</p>
               <p>On the other hand (as I may ſay, the <hi>left</hi>)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:120075:20"/>
                  <hi>the ſoule is ſometimes at a loſſe:</hi> Sorrow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times playes its reakes (as we ſay) and turns joy out of doores. The ſoule is deprived of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted injoyments, this now caſts it downe. <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row clips the ſoules wings,</hi> it makes the ſpirit <hi>flag</hi> and faint, it turns <hi>feſtivalls</hi> into <hi>mourning;</hi> It cauſeth the ſoules <hi>Spring,</hi> to bee as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne;</hi> It brings on <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>raine</hi> too; and affords the <hi>ſinging of no birds,</hi> but the <hi>Owle,</hi> and the <hi>Pellican.</hi> And quite contrary to what the ſoule is when <hi>divinely elevated,</hi> that it is while <hi>ſadly dejected.</hi> So that as joy is the <hi>Spring</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and <hi>Summer</hi> of the ſoule, ſorrow is the <hi>Autumne</hi> and <hi>Winter.</hi> You know what is the nature of <hi>Autumne</hi> and <hi>Winter:</hi> Flowers fade, leaves fall, cold nips, trees wither, ſap runnes downe, night growes long and dark too, wayes grow dirty, aire chilly, all things looke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely. Thus tis with dejected ſoules; their flowers fade, their leaves fall, &amp;c. By this you may gueſſe at the nature of ſpirituall dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yet a little more.</p>
               <p>In the Text are two words hinting the nature of ſpirituall dejections.</p>
               <p>One is <hi>caſting downe,</hi> which (as I noted in the explication) is as much as <hi>laying the ſoule levell:</hi> the bending or the bowing down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Its the ſoule ſet on the dunghill, or lying proſtrate on the ground. This is one word.</p>
               <p>The other is <hi>diſquieted:</hi> Now that word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly (as I opened it) notes a <hi>ſtorme,</hi> and <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.</hi> This then holds forth the nature of ſpirituall dejections, to be the ſoules <hi>ſtorm,</hi> and <hi>tumult.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:120075:20"/>
               <p>The ſoule caſt downe is <hi>afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts, and not comforted</hi> (as tis <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.11.) O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſts, its ſpoken unto dejected <hi>Syon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſoul caſt down is, as a <hi>tumult,</hi> things are in it, in a confuſed, diſorderly way. As when people in a rout or riot are out of all order, ſo is the ſoule when dejected.</p>
               <p>This ſhall ſuffice to hint at the nature of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall dejection. Its (you ſee in briefe) the ſoules <hi>low poſture:</hi> Its a <hi>David on a dunghill, in a valley:</hi> Its the <hi>ſouls throwing it ſelfe down:</hi> Its the ſoule in a <hi>tempeſt, toſſing and tumbling to and fro:</hi> or its the <hi>ſoule as in a tumult, quite out of the even, and orderly frame,</hi> in which it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was, and alwayes ſhould be.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the working of ſpirituall dejection, appeares <hi>in feares and doubts:</hi> The ſoule caſt down is full of doubts. One while it <hi>doubts</hi> this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120075:21"/>thing, another while that, Now this <hi>feare</hi> fills it, anon another.</p>
               <p>For look as the ſoule <hi>lifted up, is full of hope, and aſſurances,</hi> (and carried forth in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) ſo the ſoule <hi>caſt down is full of feares, and exceedingly perplexed with doubtings.</hi> Oh ſaith the poor ſoule, (dejected and diſquieted) I <hi>fear</hi> this, and I <hi>doubt</hi> this: Can you reſolve me in this <hi>doubt;</hi> or helpe mee in this <hi>feare,</hi> and the like.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The ſoule when dejected, it feares the worke of grace:</hi> It ſaith, I feare whether ever God wrought upon mee: at leaſt I doubt it. Sure I am (ſaith the dejected ſoule) <hi>God is a rocke, and his worke is perfect:</hi> But alas! there are ſo many <hi>imperfections</hi> in my ſoule, that I queſtion his worke in me: I know God works both to <hi>will and to doe:</hi> But alas! though I <hi>wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The ſoule knowes the worke of God is <hi>glorious:</hi> And ſure it is that if he <hi>will worke, none ſhall hinder:</hi> But Oh (ſaith it) I finde my ſoule ſo <hi>in-glorious,</hi> and I feele ſo many hindrances, that I <hi>doubt</hi> I ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:120075:21"/>diſhonour God to thinke, ſure I am a afftaid to ſay, he hath wrought upon me. This is one feare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſoule caſt downe,</hi> ſometime diſcovers its fears in other termes, its dejection workes up in other doubtings: As now, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its grace be true, or counterfeit. Grace</hi> that is <hi>falſe, is frequent,</hi> but that which is <hi>true, is ſcarce.</hi> Common workings are ordinarie, but ſpeciall ones are rare. Counterfeit coyne is in Beggars purſes, but true coine is the portion of the rich. I am ſure ſaith the ſoul (when it is de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jected) there <hi>is a fained ſaith,</hi> and a <hi>falſe love.</hi> Chriſt eies <hi>unfained faith,</hi> (and ſuch <hi>Tymothies</hi> was) but I feare mine is not. The Scripture calls for <hi>unfained love (let love be without diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> Rom. 12.9.) and the Apoſtles love was ſuch: Yea but I doubt mine. For my part (ſaith the poor caſt down ſoule) I queſtion not whether the <hi>faith</hi> of others in the <hi>head</hi> [Chriſt] be <hi>ſound:</hi> or whether the <hi>love</hi> of others to the <hi>members (beleevers)</hi> be <hi>ſincere:</hi> But I doub: my owne. True (ſaith the ſoule) <hi>I though once I bad faith in Chriſt, and love to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> and that my gold was not counterfeit, &amp;c. But now I feare and doubt all. Then</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Other ſoules caſt down, have other feares: ſure ſaith one, <hi>whatſoever worke is only in the letter, tis death, and not life: and for my part, I feare whether mine have been by the ſpirit. I doubt</hi> (ſaith the ſoule under dejections) <hi>whether my calling were orely by the voice of man in the bare letter, or of Chriſt in the ſpirit.</hi> Tis
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:120075:22"/>true, the word came to ſome, <hi>not in word only, but alſo in power, and in the Holy ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.5. But alas! I <hi>doubt</hi> whether it came ſo to mee. There are <hi>convictions,</hi> and <hi>comforts,</hi> which are but <hi>naturall, legall,</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> And I doubt whether mine have not been ſuch. There are indeed <hi>convincings</hi> and <hi>comfortings,</hi> which are <hi>Evangelicall</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall:</hi> Chriſt ſaith, the Holie Ghoſt <hi>ſhall convince of ſin, and of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe:</hi> but I feare he never did <hi>convince me</hi> of either: thus workes the diſquieted ſoules of ſome. Againe</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The feares of ſome in ſpirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection appeare, about their holy actions (as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, repenting, &amp;c.)</hi> And about theſe, the feares of the Soule caſt down, workes thus: I doe ſometimes <hi>pray,</hi> (or rather indeavour to pray) I do ſometimes <hi>mourn for ſin,</hi> or rather I do ſome thing like <hi>repentance,</hi> But alas! whence doth this proceed? I doubt the principles whence theſe acts do ariſe, are but <hi>poore,</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> and <hi>carnall.</hi> It may be <hi>education, profeſſion, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, morality,</hi> or (at beſt) ſome <hi>common il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination,</hi>

Some have <hi>bad ends, in good workes;</hi> others do <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all actions, from carnall principles:</hi> and I fear whether this bee not my caſe. Thus likewiſe ſome ſoules (when they are caſt down) vent themſelves.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, There are ſome who when caſt down, breath forth other feares; as now touching their ſincerity. I doubt (ſaith the dejected ſoul) <hi>whether my heart be ſound.</hi> There are many <hi>painted Sepulchres,</hi> and am not I one of them? there bee many who at beſt are but <hi>ſeeming Saints,</hi> and I feare I am ſuch. The Prophet ſaith, <hi>The heart is deceitfull above all things, and deſperately wicked,</hi> and he asketh alſo, <hi>who can know it?</hi> Jer. 17.9. For my part I do not know it: Surely, I feare, nay, I finde my heart <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked and deceitfull.</hi> I feare I looke one way, (Water-man-like) even while I row another. I fear leaſt I be a <hi>child of darkneſſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angell of light.</hi> Sometimes I doubt, if Chriſt ſhould now come to ſever the <hi>lambes</hi> from the <hi>Goates,</hi> that I ſhould have no more of a <hi>ſheep</hi> then the <hi>skinne,</hi> and that it being pluckt off, I ſhall appear as I am, <hi>Job</hi> ſaid indeed, <hi>his heart ſhould not reproach him ſo long as he lived,</hi> Job 27.6. But I am ſure, mine flyes in my face every houre. Without doubt I am but as a <hi>guilded grave;</hi> brave without, bad within. I muſt ſpeake my heart, <hi>I feare I am but an hypocrite.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:120075:23"/>
               <p>Sixtly, Others there are dejected and caſt downe, whoſe dejection diſcovers it ſelfe in <hi>fear, leaſt corruptions get the conqueſt over them.</hi> Oh ſaith the poore ſoule! I find the fleſh <hi>fighting againſt the ſpirit,</hi> and I feare the <hi>fleſh</hi> will get the day; at leſt I doubt the <hi>ſpirit</hi> will not. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ſtrong, and grace is very weake. <hi>I feare I ſhall one day fall by the hand of ſin.</hi> If I lye downe, corruption is with me, if I ariſe, its awake as ſoon as I: If I be about my calling, or imployments in the world, I perceive cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption dogges me, and if I goe to duty, it will not let me alone; nay often it is then moſt buſie: I feare, I feare, that I ſhall fall. Certainly I doubt I ſhall not ſtand long. Ah Lord! (cryes the ſoule dejected) any <hi>ſpake</hi> is enough to ſet mee <hi>a fire.</hi> Paſſion is quickly ſtirred, and I ſpeak vainly, yea, and vilely too. A little thing makes mee <hi>waſpiſh,</hi> I am borne downe with <hi>raſh anger</hi> preſently, <hi>Pride</hi> too, that appeares upon the leaſt occaſion. I can hardly <hi>pray</hi> with any <hi>inlargements,</hi> or doe <hi>duty</hi> with any <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but preſently pride pirkes it ſelfe up. <hi>Luſt</hi> too, that is ready to diſcover its life upon the leaſt occaſion: I can hardly looke, but I luſt. Thus cryes one, thus cryes another, and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, <hi>they fear ſin will get the day:</hi> At leaſt they doubt, whether ever their <hi>Pigmy-graces</hi> (ſo ſome ſpeake) ſhall bee able to get the victory over their <hi>Gyant-like-corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, Some when they are caſt down have greater fears then theſe: there are deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:120075:23"/>ſoules who cry out: <hi>Oh! they feare they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſavingly cloſe with Chriſt.</hi> To cloſe with Chriſt in the way of the Goſpell ſay they, (and they ſpeak truth,) is a myſtery: and alas! they doubt, whether they have attained it. <hi>There is a meer legall cloſing with Chriſt:</hi> which is built only upon ſome qualifications in ones ſelfe; and which carryes not the ſoule beyond the <hi>Covenant of workes:</hi> and ſome ſoules under dejection feare theirs is ſuch. Woe is mee (ſaith the ſoule) if my cloſing with Chriſt bee not aright (and I doubt it is not.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.22.</note>) Some ſoules at the laſt ſhall come, and ſpeake to him, as if they had <hi>cloſed aright</hi> with him, and as if they had in truth an <hi>intereſt</hi> in him: and yet he will ſay hee <hi>knowes them not.</hi> Now I feare, I feare leaſt I am ſuch a ſoule, and leaſt he will ſpeake to me ſo. Its damnable to be deceived in this (ſaith the ſoule) and I doubt it. Thus the <hi>wave</hi> of <hi>feare</hi> in the <hi>ſtorm</hi> of dejection, mounts thus high in ſome ſoules.</p>
               <p>Eightly, There are ſome who it may be will ſay, they doe not doubt much their cloſing with Chriſt, but they doubt their <hi>keeping cloſe. I feare</hi> (ſaith ſome ſoule caſt downe) <hi>that I ſhall deny Chriſt,</hi> There have been many <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> and I doubt I ſhal make the number one more. <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Chriſt in <hi>part,</hi> and for a time, and I feare I ſhall doe it <hi>altogether.</hi> I thinke I ſhould ſinne in <hi>deniall of,</hi> before I ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto <hi>death for</hi> Chriſt. I feare I am nearer allyed, and ſhall be more like to <hi>Demas</hi> then to <hi>Paul.</hi> Its true, there are ſome, who if they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120075:24"/>had a thouſand lives, could give them all for Chriſt; But I feare I ſhould not willingly give one. Chriſt ſaith, if wee <hi>deny him, he will deny us:</hi> And ſure he knowes what I would doe if called to it, (I feare I ſhould deny him) and therefore that he'le do ſo by me.</p>
               <p>In theſe and the like feares doe the workings of ſpirituall dejection appeare. <hi>The ſoul when elevated, is not freer from, then when dejected, it full of, feares and doubts.</hi>

As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some there be who (being dejected and caſt downe) <hi>are much diſquieted with fears and doubts about Prayer.</hi> As now, whether ever they prayed in all their lives. And if they did, whether ever God did heare or regard any of their prayers. Oh! ſaith ſome ſouls who are caſt downe: Prayer is a choice imployment, a precious priviledge, but alas! we never injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, ſomething wee have done, ſometime like prayer; but we doubt whether it were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, For</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:120075:24"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>We feare our own hearts and ſpirits were never in it:</hi> Prayer only in the <hi>lip</hi> is without <hi>life:</hi> and prayer if it be no more then <hi>words,</hi> is of no <hi>worth:</hi> God regards the prayer which comes from the ſpirit, and heart: But we doubt, though wee have ſometimes drawn <hi>neare him with our lips, our hearts have been far from him.</hi> Our prayers have been rather the fruit of our heads, and <hi>babbling of our lips,</hi> then the <hi>breath of our hearts</hi> and panting of our ſpirits. And yet (ſay ſome ſoules) Suppoſe our ſpirits were in prayer: <hi>We feare Gods ſpirit was not.</hi> The father <hi>ſeeketh ſuch</hi> to worſhip him, as do it in the ſpirit: and the Apoſtle calls for <hi>praying in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now though our own ſpirit was in our prayers, we feare Chriſts ſpirit was not. It may be wee have prayed in the gifts <hi>of the ſpirit:</hi> But what are they without the <hi>ſpirit himſelfe?</hi> Againe (ſay the ſame dejected ſoules) although wee ſhould thinke, and hope, that we have prayed both in the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of our <hi>own ſpirit,</hi> and in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>Chriſts ſpirit:</hi> yet we feare <hi>whether ever God hath regarded.</hi> Surely, he hath been alway <hi>angry</hi> with (for as yet he never anſwered any of) <hi>our prayers.</hi> And to call and not bee heard: to pray and not be anſwered,<note place="margin">Pro. 1.28.</note> is a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned judgement. This, oh this! is our feare, that we are thoſe at whoſe calamitie God will laugh, as it is, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are others who in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection vent other feares. As now, about the <hi>word: whether ever it came to them as the word of God: and as good ſeed upon good ground.</hi> Alas!
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:120075:25"/>cryeth one poore dejected ſoule: I have heard the word often preached, but I fear to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for I thinke I never heard <hi>God in it.</hi> It was the praiſe of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they heard the word; <hi>not as the word of men, but as the word of God.</hi> But its my <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> I have rather <hi>heard men,</hi> then <hi>God.</hi> I read (ſaith the ſoule) the <hi>Parable of the Sower,</hi> and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there was but one <hi>good ground,</hi> which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſeed aright; and I fear I am none of that, I doubt I am the <hi>high-way-ground,</hi> or the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> or the <hi>thorny,</hi> but ſure I am not the <hi>good ground, i. e.</hi> one who with an <hi>honeſt and good heart, having heard the word, doth keep it:</hi> for ſure I bring not <hi>forth the fruit with patience.</hi> Thus the fears of ſome dejected ſoules work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the word. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Other dejected ſouls breathe forth feares about the <hi>Promiſes: As whether they have right to them, or did ever in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cloſe with them.</hi> Oh ſay ſome ſoules! the Promiſes are indeede <hi>exceeding great and precious: But are they ours?</hi> wee doubt it, my ſoule doubts (ſaith one) when I reade the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> I doe rather read the <hi>riches</hi> of others then <hi>my owne.</hi> Alas! I feare, they are none of mine, and I dare not (indeed cannot) cloſe with them. Sometimes I have climbed the <hi>outſide</hi> of the Promiſe, I have read the <hi>letter;</hi> but alas! I never was in the <hi>inſide,</hi> in the ſpirit of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Its likely many hung upon <hi>Noahs Arke without:</hi> But none were ſaved but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120075:25"/>thoſe <hi>within.</hi> And I feare I was never <hi>within</hi> the <hi>Arke of any Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some ſoules when caſt downe, feare <hi>their very abſtinence from ſinne.</hi> As now, whether they did or doe <hi>abſtaine from ſinne, in a ſlaviſh way, for feare; or in a Sonne-like way, for love.</hi> I feare (ſaith the ſoule) I have, and I do abſtaine from ſin, rather from <hi>rationall</hi> then from <hi>pious principles.</hi> I doubt, I dread the <hi>coale</hi> of corruption rather for the <hi>fire</hi> of it, which will <hi>burne mee,</hi> then the <hi>filib</hi> of it, which will <hi>blacke mee.</hi> I doubt its the <hi>cudgell</hi> of <hi>wrath</hi> that drives me backe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the <hi>coard of love</hi> which keepes mee in, from ſinne. Good ſoules abſtaine from ſin from heavenly principles as <hi>love of God, deſire of holineſſe,</hi> and I feare my principles are <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> as feare of <hi>damnation;</hi> and, or at beſt, but <hi>earthly,</hi> as <hi>ſhame of men,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Some ſoules when caſt down cry out, Oh the ſinne <hi>againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I feare (ſaith a dejected ſoul) I have <hi>ſinned unto death.</hi> I have ſinned againſt ſuch ſtrong light, and ſuch <hi>ſweet love,</hi> that I feare my ſinne is now the <hi>unpardonable ſinne,</hi> which ſhall not, cannot <hi>bee forgiven.</hi> I may well bee caſt downe, if that bee my caſe which was <hi>Judas</hi> his: and I feare it is. Chriſt ſaith, all <hi>ſinne and blaſphemy ſhall bee forgiven, but that which is againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Alas here is my fear! that I am guilty of that ſin.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The feares of ſome when caſt downe, doe not worke thus high, yet they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120075:26"/>vent themſelves thus: <hi>Oh we feare we ſhall fall away.</hi> Angells fell, <hi>Adam</hi> fell, others fall, and are we ſurer then they? Surely we are not ſo ſtrong, and therefore not ſo ſure. Many have gone beyond me in the ſpirit, and yet (ſaith the ſoule) have ended in the <hi>fleſh:</hi> and I feare I ſhall doe ſo too. <hi>I goe but ſoftly, I fall often, I looke backe</hi> many times; and I doubt, I ſhall never perſevere unto the death: what is it to begin <hi>well,</hi> and end <hi>ill?</hi> what is it to have <hi>Ephraims righteouſneſſe? A morning dew.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! mine is no better (if ſo good.) This is my caſe; and I may well be caſt downe, for I fear I ſhall fall. The promiſe of the <hi>Crown is to perſeverance.</hi> Hee <hi>that is faithfull to the death, ſhall have the crowne of life:</hi> But I feare, I doubt, I ſhall not hold out <hi>neare unto death,</hi> for my heart miſgives me, and I feare I ſhall fall away ere long, and <hi>looſe all at laſt.</hi>

                  <hi>David</hi> vents himſelfe, not onely in feares, but in ſorrowes. <hi>His teares were his meat day and night,</hi> as it is, verſ.. 3. He <hi>went in mourning,</hi> ver. 9. Sighs, complaints, expoſtulations: thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are the workings of ſpirituall dejection. Ah Lord! what paleneſſe of face? what wringing of the hands? what watering of the cheeks, doth dejection produce? what beating of the breaſt with the Publican? what weeping and crying with <hi>Rachell?</hi> what queſtioning and crying with <hi>Mary,</hi> doth caſting down, cauſe?</p>
               <p>There are two appearances of theſe kind of workings.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Within,</hi> The ſoule toſſeth it ſelfe up and downe: the heart rowles and beates, as if it would breake its paſſage through the body. How doth the ſoule talke with its ſelfe, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate its griefe? How is the <hi>heart ſmitten,</hi> and <hi>withered as graſſe,</hi> as tis, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.4.

               </list>
               <p>Thus griefe vents it ſelfe, and thus doth the diſquieted ſoule (as it thinkes) eaſe it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But I neede not go about to paint theſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes: ſome ſoules are able too well (it may be) to tell what theſe workings of dejection are. Let this ſuffice for that ſecond head, <hi>viz.</hi> the workings of ſpirituall dejection.</p>

               <p>Theſe I finde to bee the maine (though ſometimes there are other) cauſes why the ſoul is caſt downe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Remainders of corruption.</hi> Sin gave the ſoule its firſt fall: 'Twas that which firſt caſt down <hi>Adam;</hi> and tis that which ſtill diſquiets the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Its true, grace is the ſouls recovery from ſin; whom God converts, he doth cure: But yet corruption being never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in this life mortified, the remainders thereof
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120075:27"/>trouble the ſoule (even of a Saint) many times. The remainders of corruptions are like unto the remainders of ſome <hi>peccant humours,</hi> which (even after a ſure recovery) do ſometimes groan, and cauſe <hi>aguiſh</hi> ſhiverings.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Falls into ſinne:</hi> Every new act of ſinne, is a tripping up of the ſoules heels. When <hi>David fell</hi> into ſin, he was <hi>caſt downe.</hi> Belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are lyable to <hi>falling into ſin,</hi> and this makes them lyable to <hi>failing in ſoule.</hi> Its no wonder to ſee a ſoule <hi>diſquieted</hi> in point of comfort, if it have been <hi>defiled</hi> in practiſe of corruption. Its no marvell if <hi>Iſrael</hi> fall before the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> if <hi>Achan</hi> be in the Campe. A ſinning <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> will ſoon make a ſtorming Sea.

               <p n="3">3 <hi>Ignorance of the Covenant of grace.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is by grace that we ſtand; and if we be ignorant of that, we ſhall ſoone be caſt down. I am perſwaded that this is the greateſt (I had almoſt ſaid the only) reaſon why ſoules are at any time Caſt downe; <hi>viz.</hi> they know not the Covenant of grace, at leaſt they are ignorant of it.</p>

               <p n="1">1 They are ignorant of it in its <hi>fullneſſe.</hi> What could diſquiet the ſoule, if it knew the Covenant of grace extended it ſelfe unto every <hi>ſin in its pardon, and to every grace in its ſupply,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:120075:28"/>The ſoul is apt to <hi>limit the holy one of Iſrael.</hi> Its apt to think there are ſome ſins unto which the Covenant doth not extend. It beleives it may be, the Covenant of grace reacheth to the pardon of many ſins; but queſtions whether it reach to <hi>all.</hi> If it did not queſtion that, why is it caſt downe ſo, that it doubts the pardon of <hi>ſome</hi> ſins? Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are ignorant of its <hi>freeneſſe.</hi> How would the ſoul live above diſquiets, and dejections, if it did but know and beleive the Covenant were <hi>free, wholly free, conſtantly free, every way, and in every part of it free?</hi> Its our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, we are apt to mixe works with grace; and to cloud the Covenant with Conditions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we are to know, that the Covenant is onely <hi>grace,</hi> the nature of which is to bar out workes. For <hi>if by grace, then it is no more of workes.</hi> OTHERWISE GRACE IS NO MORE GRACE; <hi>and if it be of workes, then is it no more of grace,</hi> OTHERWISE WORKES IS NO MORE WORKES: as it is in that <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den place. Rom.</hi> 11.6. The ſoule when caſt down ſaith, it wants this <hi>condition,</hi> and it wants that <hi>qualification:</hi> But alas! it knowes not, that the Covenant <hi>gives</hi> all, and requires none. Its free, infinitely free, and did the ſoule know this, it would be raiſed, but its the ignorance of this that caſts it down. And beſides,</p>
               <p n="3">3 Soules know not the <hi>firmeneſſe</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace: they are apt to thinke it mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Did the ſoule but know, that Gods foundation ſtandeth firme, and is ſtill the ſame,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120075:28"/>ſurely it could not eaſily be dejected. Why conſider, ye dejected hearts! Gods Covenant is not changeable. Though you faile on your part, yet he'le be faithfull on his. God will not caſt off Iſrael <hi>for all that they had done,</hi> as tis <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.37. His Covenant was as <hi>firme as heaven,</hi> though their carriage had been as <hi>foule as bell.</hi> The Covenant of grace is the Covenant of <hi>an unalterable, and unaltering God:</hi> God knew what fickleneſſe was in the ſoul ere he entred into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>I knew</hi> (ſaith the Lord) and Oh! mark it, mind it ſoules) <hi>that thou wouldeſt deale very treacherouſly:</hi> as tis <hi>Eſa.</hi> 48.8. Gods <hi>bow</hi> is ſtill in the cloud; though the imaginations of the heart of man is evill. Dejected ſoules meaſure God by themſelves, but they know not <hi>his thoughts are above theirs,</hi> They know not the firmeneſſe of his Covenant, therefore it is that they are ſo often caſt down.</p>
               <p>Thus the ignorance of the Covenant of grace, is a prime and principall cauſe of ſoul dejection. Then</p>
               <p n="4">4 Another cauſe of dejection is, <hi>ſpirituall indiſpoſition unto duties.</hi> The ſoul is (it may be) as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was, it riſeth and findeth its ſtrength gone. The ſoul peradventure could <hi>ſaile</hi> as with a <hi>full gale</hi> in duty heretofore, but now (alas) it can hardly (as they ſay) <hi>ſterne the tide, i.e.</hi> keep up againſt indiſpoſition. The living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were wont to flow out of the ſoule in power, and fullneſſe, are, it may be ſtopped; the ſoule findes not that alacrity and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>freeneſſe,</hi> that it was wont to finde. Time was, it could
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:120075:29"/>more God-ward, and Chriſt-ward upon the leaſt breathing: But alas! Now the ſpirit breaths, and blows ſtrongly, and the ſoul is ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh. It riſeth to go it may be, but with that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, willingneſſe,</hi> and it ſtrives to act, but with that <hi>dead livelineſſe,</hi> that ſurely it thinkes all its ſtrength is gone, and that it is but in vain to doe any thing, &amp;c. and this caſts it downe. Or</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Want of former incomes in duties</hi> do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſome. Alas cry dejected ſouls! we doe as much as ever, but we want much of our incomes. Time was, I could hardly liſp but God heard; and now I pray often, and no returne at all. <hi>Job</hi> he cryes out: <hi>Oh that it were as in the months paſſed: as in the dayes when God preſerved me: when his candle ſhined upon my head; and when by his light I walked through darkeneſſe,</hi> Job: 29.2, 3. Oh ſaith the ſoule! I pray, read, hear, meditate, confer, communicate, &amp;c. as much, if not more then formerly; and yet I injoy leſſe. What ſhall, or can I ſay to this? what, to <hi>ſow</hi> much, and <hi>reape</hi> but little: To <hi>eate,</hi> and not to eate <hi>enough;</hi> to <hi>drinke,</hi> and not to be <hi>filled;</hi> to earne wages, and not to put it into the bag, (ſo the ſoule alludes unto that <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6.) is not this ſtrange? Sure I may well be diſquieted, who <hi>fiſh all night and catch nothing,</hi> who act much, and have but little, or no income. Time was, when the ſpirit blew, and my ſpices flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Time was, when the <hi>King ſat at his table, and my ſpiknard ſmelt:</hi> Time was, when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſmiled, the ſon imbraced, and the ſpirit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120075:29"/>warmed in every duty, in every Ordinance. But now; oh now! I want theſe injoyed incomes, and may I not well bee diſquieted, and caſt downe?</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>The inſultation of Satan and Enemies,</hi> Sometimes cauſeth caſtings downe. Satan is <hi>impudent,</hi> and he doth ſometimes <hi>inſult:</hi> if hee perceive the ſoule a little more then ordinary ſad, he takes advantage preſently to ſay, <hi>Where is now your God? David</hi> was much diſquieted, and went in mourning, <hi>becauſe of the oppreſſion of the enemy, Pſal.</hi> 42.9. I am apt to thinke, Satan may at leſt be included in that word, the <hi>Enemy,</hi> For he is, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120075:30"/>ſoules are ſo weake as to bee caſt downe.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Even corporall affliction is ſometimes a cauſe of ſpirituall caſting downe. A ſick-body</hi> many times cauſeth a <hi>ſad ſoule.

That tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall relation of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> caſting downe: is ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled thus, <hi>the writing of</hi> Hezekiah <hi>King of Judah when he had been ſicke,</hi> Eſay 38.9. Indeede it falls out ſo; that the ſoule (following the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the body) is much diſquieted, when the body is afflicted. Many ſouls chearfull enough when in health, are over ſad when ſicke. If God afflict the body, we are apt upon that our ſelves, to caſt downe the ſoule. Its need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in this to expatiate, experience too too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſhewes this, that externall affliction, is oft the principal, and firſt cauſe of internall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Adde to all theſe in the laſt place this, viz. <hi>ſence of Divine wrath.</hi> This indeed of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the greateſt, and moſt grounded cauſe of ſpirituall dejection.

               <p>There bee but three words of Application which I ſhall touch on, in this Section and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Let this informe us of our imperfect ſtate while we are in the fleſh.</hi> Our higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are not ſo ſure, as to deliver us from feare of falling. Saints you ſee of the richeſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120075:31"/>ſort, even ſuch as are choiceſt, are apt to be, and ſometimes are, much caſt down. Its the vanity of ſome, that they thinke and ſpeake of preſent injoyments <hi>above what is meet.</hi> Some have ſaid, <hi>Soules may come up to ſuch a height, as that they neither ſhall, nor [can] be diſquieted.</hi> Yea, ſome go ſo far, as to cenſure all kind of doubting; and to conclude ſoules in a-<hi>damnable</hi> ſtate, becauſe in a <hi>diſquieted.</hi> Surely ſuch have not learned this truth <hi>as it is in Jeſus.</hi> You ſee a <hi>David caſt downe, and diſquieted:</hi> And you heare that even choiceſt Saints, <hi>upon many cauſes, are lyable to the like dejections.</hi> Bee informed therefore to take heed, how you dreame of a <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>unalterable enjoyment of reſt here:</hi> Your reſt, though <hi>unſpeakeably</hi> ſweet, is not <hi>unchangeably</hi> ſure.

                  </note> yea, and his bottome was free grace; <hi>Divine good pleaſure had made his mountain ſo firme,</hi> Pſal. 30.6, 7. And yet marke this, <hi>David</hi> is now <hi>moved</hi> very much, even to a <hi>ſoul-tumult. Howle Fir-trees for the Cedar is fallen.</hi> Be not <hi>high-minded</hi> ye babes in Chriſt, ſith <hi>father</hi> may, and do fall. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if this be a truth (as its clear it is) that Saints of the higheſt attainments may be, and ſometimes are caſt down, then ſurely, there is no perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120075:31"/>ſtate of peace, and unſettledneſſe here. Its true, when we come home, we ſhall ſit down, and be diſquieted no more: But our hope is not here, <hi>Whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6, Such as talke of being at <hi>home</hi> in this life, forget that they are in the body. Chriſtians beware of it, for its a deluſion, to thinke that here you are above dejection, you are not at any time ſo ſetled, but you may be diſquieted. And therefore</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Learne hence to be thankefull for any freedome from diſquietings.</hi> Be thankefull (O ye unſhaken ſoules) to Chriſt! Its his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which hath kept you from being in a <hi>ſtorm.</hi> Its greater mercy to have a ſoule kept free from diſquietings then to have a body kept free from diſtempers; ſeeſt thou another ſoul caſt downe? be thankfull to the Lord Jeſus that thou art not ſitting by it in the ſame caſe. Take heed of thinking that your ſettlement is of your ſelves; and conſequently, of cerſuring others, who are diſquieted. Its certainly a great fault in many, that they cenſure ſuch as they ſee dejected: <hi>They find fault with that in others, which they are not able to prevent in themſelves;</hi> Did not Chriſt beare up thy ſpirit (Oh ſoule!) thou wouldeſt quickly ſincke: There are cauſes of ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in thee, as well as in others. Its Chriſt that <hi>keepes them under,</hi> otherwiſe they would ſoon <hi>caſt thee down.</hi> Bee thankefull therefore to Chriſt, and take heed of cenſuring others. Yea,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prepare for dejections.</hi> Such as are ſubject to <hi>ſaintings,</hi> have their <hi>cordialls</hi> in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120075:32"/>ſo ſhould you have (O ſoules) who are lyable to ſpirituall faintings. There are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials enough, did you know them. Its your Saviours goodneſſe, that hee ſtored up reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſuitable to all your diſtempers: acquaint your ſelves with them, before you need them, that they may not be to ſeeke, when they ſhould be uſed.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay, what preparation ſhall we make?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For this I ſhall ſpeak ſomething more generall, and ſomething more particular.</p>
               <p>Generally, In order to ſpirituall preparation for ſoule dejection, mind theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſuch a thing there is as ſoul-deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that you are lyable unto it.</hi> Be not ſtrangers unto this truth, but know, as the moſt <hi>healthfull body</hi> may ſometimes be diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered; ſo the moſt holy <hi>ſoule</hi> may ſometimes be diſquieted. The not minding of this, makes many ſoules which are caſt downe, ſadder then otherwiſe they would be. Its an aggravation unto any ſorrow; that it comes unexpected. Be ſure therefore to remember this, that tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſadneſſe may ſeize upon your ſoules, and caſt you down: Its common to ſaints to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſometimes. This being often and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thought on, before dejections come, will prepare you to beare them when they come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Be well acquainted with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of grace;</hi> The not aright, and clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it (as hath been ſhewed) is the cauſe of much dejection. Acquaint your ſouls
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120075:32"/>therefore with this, in the <hi>freeneſſe</hi> of it, doe not mix <hi>water</hi> with <hi>wine,</hi> 'twill abate the ſtrength of it, and render it leſſe able to comfort; what God holds forth <hi>free,</hi> let not us looke upon as <hi>conditionall.</hi> The <hi>pure wine of the Covenant</hi> (which is the beſt cordiall for a fainting ſpirit) looſeth its vertue, when tis <hi>mixed</hi> with the pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle <hi>waters of conditions.</hi> Bee built up therefore in the <hi>freeneſſe of the Covenant;</hi> Know alſo the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of it. It extends it ſelfe to the forgiving of <hi>all</hi> ſinnes; and to the beſtowing of <hi>all</hi> grace: Remember alſo the <hi>firmeneſſe</hi> of the Covenant; its <hi>immutable, unalterable,</hi> whatſoever fainting fit overtakes thee, the Covenant of grace thus known, and beleeved, will revive thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Treaſure up your own and others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences.</hi> The remembrance of experiences in times of lifting up, will exceedingly ſupport in times of caſting downe: when the ſpirit begins to be in a ſtorme for divine abſence; Call to minde, that it ſometime injoyed the calme of a divine preſence. Many ſoules forget the time of their <hi>first love,</hi> and the effect of that is <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe;</hi> And many forget the day of <hi>Chriſts firſt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve,</hi> and the fruit of that is <hi>ſadneſſe.</hi> In the <hi>day of your dejections,</hi> call to mind the time <hi>of your eſpouſalls.</hi> The premeditation of what the ſoule ſometimes enjoyed, is a good prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a time, when it may be dejected.</p>
               <p>But theſe things are onely in the generall. I ſhall therefore proceed to particulars. And my adviſe to ſoules is, that they indeavour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves (as much as they can) with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120075:33"/>particular caſes; And accordingly to provide <hi>ſuitable cordialls.</hi> Its a peece of humain pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in proviſion for corporall diſtempers, that men do not only lay up ſome generall, <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke medicines</hi> (as Phiſitians call them.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note>) But they provide particular medicins for particular diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: Surely we ſhould be (if not more yet at leaſt) as much careful in proviſion for ſpiritual diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as for corporal. And in order thereunto we ſhould ſtudy to underſtand what may be a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſupport unto us, under ſoul-caſtings down.

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But conſider (O ſoules) <hi>Gods workes are not alway alike:</hi> Though the worke of grace
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:120075:34"/>be the ſame in all, in regard of the <hi>matter,</hi> yet it is not the ſame alwayes in regard of the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> The manner of Chriſts working is divers, Its bad eyeing (in order to the judgement of our worke of grace) <hi>examples.</hi> Chriſt comes to <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> at the receit of cuſtome: and ſpeakes to his heart ſo home; that <hi>Matthew</hi> leaves all, and followes him, and of a <hi>Publican</hi> becomes a <hi>Preacher.</hi> But he rides after <hi>Paul</hi> (as I may ſay) and overtakes him in the way to <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and <hi>throwes him downe,</hi> invirons him with a Pillar of light, appears to him from heaven: ſpeakes to him, reaſons with him; directs him whether to go, what to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not alike. Should you bind the work of grace to <hi>Pauls example,</hi> you would condemn <hi>Matthew:</hi> or ſhould you make the example of <hi>Matthew</hi> the pattern of the worke of grace, you would, or might queſtion <hi>Paul.</hi> Be cautious therefore O ſoule of what you ſay. Do not fear that God hath not wrought upon you, becauſe not after the example of ſuch an one: exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not here ſtrictly to be eyed, this is the firſt caution.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this, <hi>Take heed of confining Chriſt to methods.</hi> I wiſh ſome Preachers were in this particular faultleſſe: they confine Chriſt (as I may ſay) to ſuch and ſuch wayes, and methods, as if the ſpirit were not as <hi>free</hi> as the <hi>wind,</hi> to blow where, and when, and how he liſteth. You have ſome ſo punctuall in their <hi>antecedents, concomitants,</hi> and <hi>conſequents</hi> (words which many poore ſoules ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:120075:35"/>And ſo preciſe, and ſtrict in preſſing ſoules with them, that many gracious ſoules feare, whether they have any worke of grace wrought, becauſe not in ſuch a way and <hi>method.</hi> Now I beſeech you, beware of this, <hi>Chriſt walkes not alwayes the ſame way to many ſoules;</hi> Some ſoules he overtakes ere ever they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of him, as is hinted <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.12. and makes them as <hi>the chariots of Aminidab; i. e.</hi> a willing people. Others indeed he deales with all in a more <hi>violent way:</hi> and is faine to make it a <hi>day of power,</hi> that they may be a <hi>willing people.</hi> In the ſame ſtory <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6. you have Chriſt as it were,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Softly comming into</hi> Lydia's <hi>he art</hi> (as if he did but lift up the Hatch and enter) and you have him <hi>loudly knocking at the Jaylers</hi> doore, making (as I may ſay) an earthquake in his ſoul, to make way for himſelfe. So various are Chriſts wayes in working: Some Chriſt makes <hi>ſicke of love,</hi> and <hi>winnes</hi> upon their hearts by the <hi>mercies of the</hi> Goſpell: Others he makes <hi>ſore with wrath; and frights</hi> them to himſelfe by the <hi>terrours of the Law.</hi> Mind this, oh poore ſoule; It may be thou feareſt Chriſt hath not wrought on thee, becauſe it was not in ſuch or ſuch a way: your feare (if ſo) is groundleſſe; and you muſt take heed, leſt you confine Chriſt unto methods. <hi>He will worke, and who ſhall let it, and to whom hath he made knowne all his wayes of working.</hi> This is the ſecond Caution. Now the</p>
               <p>Third is this, <hi>Beware how you conclude any thing upon preſent ſence.</hi> The worke of grace
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:120075:35"/>at firſt is but <hi>little,</hi> as a <hi>grain of muſtard ſeed;</hi> And tis not at firſt ſo viſible: Its like <hi>leaven</hi> [hid] <hi>in meale,</hi> as tis <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.33. Now that which is <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>hidden</hi> too; that is not ſeen ſtraite. Naturall conceptions are not at firſt perceived; no more are ſupernaturall. The worke of grace may be begun in thy ſoule, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou doe not perceive it. Be therefore cautious how thou concludes becauſe of preſent viſible ineffectualneſſe. <hi>The leaven of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, may lye hid in the heart</hi> And if thou judge by preſent ſence, thou mayeſt condemne the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the righteous.</hi> Indeed Chriſt in the ſoul is as <hi>Iſaack</hi> in <hi>Abrahams loynes</hi> (at firſt) that is, as dead: And looke <hi>as there, even of one, and him as good as dead, ſprang as many as the ſtars of the skie:</hi> So likewiſe here, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſoule of <hi>one graine of grace, and that even as dead</hi> to ſence,<note place="margin">See Lu. 13.19.</note> there ſprings up the <hi>great tree</hi> which reacheth as high as heaven. Let this therefore be minded as the third caution, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not poſitively any thing upon preſent ſence.</p>
               <p>Now having hinted theſe Cautions, I ſhall offer three <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> unto ſuch as feare and doubt, the true worke of grace in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This fear may peradventure be a fruit of the worke of grace.</hi> Sinners as they never deſire the worke, ſo they trouble not themſelves with doubts about the work: <hi>Solomon</hi> tels us, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway:</hi> yea, we know he alſo ſaid, <hi>the way of a foole is right in his owne eyes.</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:120075:36"/>Thou poore ſoule, who are dejected, and doſt much doubt whether ever as yet, God hath wrought upon thy heart: why, this feare of thine, may bee a good ſigne that hee hath. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This fear may argue a beginning of the worke.</hi> Certain this fear is of God: and how doſt thou know, but that now God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, (at leſt) <hi>to worke upon thee.</hi> Its a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth,<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdome:</hi> Now the meaning hereof may be, that the <hi>firſt thing</hi> (for ſo the word ſignifieth) which is wrought in the ſoule, in the worke of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> (i.e. of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>bolineſſe</hi> (for ſo wiſdom ſignifies) is <hi>feare.</hi> Thy feare therefore may hint, that the worke is in <hi>ſieri,</hi> i. e. <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> if it be not in <hi>factu,</hi> i. e. begun already. However <hi>God may make uſe of it to that end.</hi> What canſt thou tell, but now that thy ſoule is troubled with doubtings about the worke of grace: God may make uſe of this feare to drive <hi>thee out of thy ſtate of nature, and to draw thee into the ſtate of grace.</hi> How many poore ſouls have cryed out; <hi>I have no true grace: God hath not at all wrought upon my heart: woe is me what ſhall I doe; Ile run after him, Ile cry for him, &amp;c.</hi> And while the ſoul hath been in this feare, God hath begunne (making uſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) to worke really upon their ſoule. Thus it hath been with ſome, conſider it may be with thee ſo, And therefore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Suppoſe it be as you feare;</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God hath as yet never effectually wrought

               <p>Qu: <hi>Nay, but</hi> what ſhould move God to work on me: <hi>Alas, I am a poor polluted ſinner, and will the Lord take pleaſure in ſuch a ſoule as I am, and beſtow paines to worke on me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In Anſwer to this, know (O ſoul) <hi>free grace ſhall move God,</hi> For <hi>of grace we are ſaved, and not of our ſelves:</hi> its the gift of God, we are his worke-man-ſhip, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 10.

               <p>BUt alas! ſay ſome, who are caſt downe, our doubts are not ſo much about a worke of grace; As <hi>about the truth of grace.</hi> I doubt (ſaith a ſoul) whether my grace be true;<note place="margin">Caſe.</note> ſome worke I have had, and ſomething is brought forth, but I queſtion <hi>whether it be not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Something
<list>
                     <item>1 <hi>More generally,</hi>
                     </item>

                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>More generally,</hi> I deſire ſuch dejected ſoules, as are troubled about this fear, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 3 things.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:120075:37"/>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider, counterfeit grace doth not uſe to ſuſpect it ſelfe, neither is it willing to be tryed.</hi> He that doth evill commeth not to the light; nay, he <hi>hateth the light,</hi> as tis <hi>John</hi> 3.20. But he that doth truth, commeth to the light, &amp;c. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may ſecretly hint that thy grace is <hi>currant,</hi> ſith thou deſireſt its <hi>tryall:</hi> were thy grace <hi>counterfeit</hi> (as thou ſuſpecteſt) it would deſire <hi>concealement,</hi> at leſt, it would not put thee on to ſuſpect it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider, its a mercy to have a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſpirit.</hi> Many ſoules are deceived, and damned for want of this. <hi>Satan lyes ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an imperfect, and pretended worke of grace.</hi> You read of a <hi>ſpirit of ſlumber</hi> in the Scripture. God hath given ſome up to the <hi>ſpirit of ſlumber,</hi> Rom. 11.8. There are <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> who preſume, and <hi>ſleep,</hi> and ſleeping periſh. Chriſts ſpirit where it is, is a ſpirit of <hi>fire and burning:</hi> Now fire that tryes, Chriſts ſpirit is like a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers fire: Its a mercy to have the ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining, and trying; whereas its a judgement to be ſelfe-confident, not at all ſuſpicious, It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the ſpirit of ſlumber. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider, tis poſſible for one truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to conceit that his grace is but counterfeit.</hi> As children conceive <hi>braſſe</hi> is <hi>gold,</hi> ſo ſometimes they conceit <hi>gold</hi> to be <hi>braſſe,</hi> Its ſtrange to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtrength of conceit, eſpecially in depth of Melancholly. Peradventure oh ſoule thy fear is but conceit! Surely we ſee ſometimes <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> conceiting in their joyallity, that their counterfeit grace, is true. And why may wee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120075:38"/>not thinke? (nay, by experience we find) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, truely gracious hearts conceiting their grace is counterfeit. But theſe conſiderations are onely general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>More particularly,</hi> that I may ſatifie ſuch dejected fouls, as doubt the truth of their grace, I ſhall lay down theſe concluſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Many ſouls doubt the truth of their grace becauſe of their wrong way of tryall.</hi> There are falſe <hi>Touch-ſtones,</hi> which may make pure <hi>gold</hi> ſuſpitious, as well as make <hi>braſſe</hi> appeare as <hi>gold.</hi> To inſtance, its a falſe and deceiving way of tryall, to try the truth of grace by <hi>conqueſt.</hi> My meaning is, to conclude that my grace is not true, becauſe I am ſometimes conquered by corruption; its a wrong way of concluſion, and a falſe touch-ſtone of tryall. <hi>Paul</hi> had truth of grace, and yet ſometimes he was <hi>conquered,</hi> and carryed captive, and <hi>ſold</hi> (ſlave-like) <hi>by ſinne,</hi> Rom: 7.14.

Tis true <hi>the righteous is bold as a Lyon;</hi> but this is not at all times alike. <hi>Peter</hi> had truth of love to Chriſt; and yet he was not ſo <hi>undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alwayes:</hi> His deriall is knowne well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. So that now (to apply this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) it may be (Oh dejected ſoule) thou tryeſt thy grace the wrong way. Thou ſayeſt thou art conquered oft; and <hi>led captive</hi> many times; Bee it ſo, thy grace may be ſound for all this. Thoſe that ſcome the Turkiſh power, may ſometimes bee (ſlave-like) in his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120075:38"/>Gallies: And a loyall ſubject of Jeſus Chriſt, may be ſometimes overtaken, and <hi>taken,</hi> and ſold <hi>Paul</hi>-like under ſin. But</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>In judging the truth of our grace, we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye its quality,</hi> then <hi>its quantity.</hi> As now faith, the truth of that is ſeen, rather in its <hi>quality,</hi> then in its <hi>quantity.</hi> There may be a faith big enough to <hi>remove mountaines, and yet FALSE</hi> (as is deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from, 1 <hi>Gor.</hi> 13.2.)

Peradventure O ſoule thou art grieved to ſee thy grace ſo little, and that makes thee feare tis falſe: but know this thy feare is fooliſh. <hi>The leaſt duſt of gold, is gold; and the leaſt grain of grace, is grace.</hi> In judging thy grace (O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſoule) know thou ſhouldeſt eye its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not its quantity. And in order to this,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, know, <hi>That grace is true which is diffuſive.</hi> I would aske thee O ſoule! (that doubteſt thy grace is counterfeit) whether it be <hi>diffuſive</hi> yea, or no: though it be little, doth it <hi>ſpread it ſelfe?</hi> Is thy little in <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> too? Hypocrites have much in the <hi>head,</hi> little in the <hi>heart.</hi> But ſee O ſoule, doth not thy little ſpread; Is it not <hi>leaven?</hi> doth it not <hi>leaven thee all over?</hi> Is it not in thy <hi>will?</hi> thou wouldeſt: and doth it not ſpread to thy <hi>deſire?</hi> thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: And becauſe thou canſt not, doth it not <hi>leaven</hi> thy ſorrow? Is not that <hi>ſower</hi> (or rather ſweet) doſt not <hi>grieve</hi> becauſe thou carſt not <hi>doe,</hi> as thou wouldeſt and deſireſt? Do not O ſoule murder thy ſelfe: I meane kill thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120075:39"/>by not witneſſing to the truth. Cannot you ſee, and ſay, your little grace is diffuſive. Surely if it be, you need not doubt its truth, and you ſhould not ſay tis counterfeit.</p>

Look as in <hi>Samuels caſe,</hi> it was the <hi>Lord</hi> called him, and he thought 'twas <hi>Eli</hi> (as 'tis 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.) ſo it may be with you, and the reaſon may be, as it was in <hi>Samuels</hi> caſe: He was a child, and ſo <hi>did not know yet</hi> (as the text ſaith) <hi>the Lord:</hi> It may be thou art a <hi>child as yet</hi> (O ſoule) and art not ſo well able to diſtinguiſh of the Lord <hi>from men:</hi> Thou as <hi>yet</hi> mayeſt not be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>myſteries of the ſpirit?</hi> and therefore thou mayeſt thinke tis only man, when it was the ſpirit which called thee. Hereafter when thou ſhalt grow up to a fuller age in Chriſt, this childiſh thing, and feare may be done away: And thou ſhalt no more <hi>ſpeake as a child,</hi> and ſay thou feareſt 'twas man only that called thee. But thou ſhalt be <hi>taught of God,</hi> and know thou wert called by the ſpirit.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Call to minde, <hi>in what frame of ſoule thou wert</hi> (if thou canſt call it to mind) <hi>when thy firſt call was; and conſider what it was, and is, which doth prevaile with you.</hi> Happily thy ſoul was in a direct way of oppoſing God: and thou didſt little thinke of him, when he called thee: <hi>The more unexpected it was, the more of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was in the call.</hi> Beſides, ſay O ſoule: was it not <hi>naked truth, plaine, ſimple truth,</hi> that did, and doth moſt take with thy heart. Surely, <hi>the more plaine truth was, which did worke upon you, the more of the ſpirit was in that worke.</hi> Its a rule caſe; <hi>the leſſe of man, the more of God:</hi> Art not able to ſay (O ſoule) that thou wert go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in a vaine, vile way of living without God; and that thou wert ſo taken up with the world, and vanity, &amp;c. that God <hi>was not in all thy thoughts:</hi> And that at a time thou didſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read or hear ſuch or ſuch a <hi>naked truth:</hi> As to inſtance, that thou wert a <hi>child of wrath by nature, that out of Chriſt there is no hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, &amp;c.</hi> And that hereupon unexpectedly, thou didſt find thy heart moved to take another courſe: Peradventure, thou hadſt read or heard and didſt know the ſame truth before; O but at ſuch or ſuch a time, thou didſt find thy heart more wrought upon, by it, then ever. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſeriouſly ſay, hath it not been thus with you? If it hath, why doubt ye, that your call is not by the ſpirit? But</p>
               <p n="3">3 Call to mind, <hi>And in ſincerity tell, and confeſſe, what it was that thou wert ialled from; and what it is that thou wert called to,</hi> Canſt not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120075:40"/>thou ſay, thy call was not ſo much (at leſt) not only from <hi>miſery,</hi> but it was from <hi>ſinne.</hi> Tis true, many a man by naturall conſcience, and fleſhly principles is thus far wrought upon in a call, that it is willing to come out of <hi>miſery;</hi> I but thy ſoule can ſay, it was willing to come from <hi>ſinne:</hi> and 'twas from that, which in thy call, thy heart was taken off. Yea, and art not thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay, thou didſt find thy heart in thy call, really going out after (as conceiving thou wert <hi>called, unto holineſſe,</hi> (as tis 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7.) Cannot you appeale to God, that in your call, you did (at leſt that now you do,) find your hearts, not only called and made willing to leave a <hi>ſorrowfull eſtate,</hi> and come into a <hi>happy one:</hi> But alſo to leave a <hi>ſinfull eſtate,</hi> and come into a <hi>holy eſtate.</hi> Certainly, if your call were not only from <hi>miſery,</hi> but from <hi>ſinne:</hi> And if it were to be as well, and as much (nay more) unto <hi>holineſſe,</hi> then unto freedom from <hi>miſery:</hi> I ſay if you can clear this: (And do not your conſciences, oh ye deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls witneſſe to this) then why do ye doubt? what reaſon have you to feare, that your call was not of the ſpirit? To come therefore to the other thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To your <hi>Conviction.</hi> You ſay you doubt whether that were of the ſpirit, and <hi>evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall,</hi> or only by the letter, and <hi>legall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to ſatisfie you in this, there are 3 queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I would put unto you. And in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of your hearts reſolve them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>What was the great ſin, of which you were, and are convicted:</hi> when thy heart was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120075:41"/>of ſin, what was the greateſt ſinne, which then thou wert convinced of. Search your hearts, and conſider what anſwer to give? <hi>can you ſay it was unbeleife:</hi> Certainly, if you were convinced of that, it was the ſpirit which wrought that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. I deſire not to be miſtaken: <hi>I do not urge this, as if I thought there either were not, or nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not any more conviction then this:</hi> (for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſaving conviction extends it ſelfe to all ſin, and in particular, to our particular ſpeciall ſinnes.)</p>
               <p>But my aime is, to hint ſomething <hi>as a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diſcovery of conviction by the ſpirit</hi> (and in order to this it is, which I am now ſpeaking.) Now then, wert thou ever convinced of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe? Haſt thou ſeen this to be a <hi>ſin?</hi> yea, and to be a great <hi>ſin?</hi> Certainly, if thou haſt, thy conviction hath been of the Holy Ghoſt. Its the peculiar worke of the ſpirit to convince of <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,</hi> as tis John 16.9.11. Many a ſoule is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of theſe, or theſe ſins: But the ſoule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the ſpirit, is convinced of this ſin (as of the ſin of ſinnes) viz. <hi>unbeleefe,</hi> Oh (ſaith a ſoul) which is convinced by the ſpirit, I know <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe</hi> is a ſin, <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> is a ſinne, <hi>pride</hi> a ſin, &amp;c. But I know <hi>unbeleef is a ſin as great,</hi> ray, <hi>greater then them all.</hi> This is laid upon my ſpirit, that Chriſt is come into the world <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovering</hi> the love of God, <hi>freely tendering</hi> reconcilement in his blood, But I (Oh I!) did <hi>little ſee,</hi> and <hi>much ſlight him;</hi> I did not make it my worke to go after him, nor have I been willing when he hath come after me, to <hi>accept
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120075:41"/>him.</hi> And this (oh this!) hath been (nay, I fear 'tis ſtill) <hi>my ſin.</hi> Oh this <hi>baſe, vile, damnable unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, is</hi> that which hath, and doth lye upon my ſpirit. <hi>Other ſins put me in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of ſalvation; and this ſealed me under damnation:</hi> HEE THAT BELEEVETH NOT, HE IS CONDEMNED ALREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DY, Oh that Scripture, tooke hold on me, Chriſt came, and was willing to imbrace, but I would not beleeve; He came <hi>ſweetly weeing,</hi> and I ſtood out <hi>ſinfully rejecting.</hi> He <hi>tendered grace freely,</hi> and I <hi>did put off that tender wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly;</hi> He <hi>ſaid come unto me, and ile eaſe you;</hi> and I did not, could not, would not <hi>beleeve,</hi> and therefore came not to him. This (O this!) I am convinced of, as my ſin; and this I doubt is my ſin to this day. The truth is, I can hardly beleive <hi>yet,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſinners.</hi> Why, ſay (Oh ſoul) doth not thy heart anſwer to theſe things, as <hi>face to face?</hi> is there not a <hi>copy</hi> of this complaint in the ſecret <hi>tables of thy heart?</hi> If there be, pray who ſhould, nay, who could <hi>write</hi> it, but the <hi>ſpirit?</hi> Who could take theſe <hi>things of Chriſt, and reveale them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, but the ſpirit?</hi> Surely, if none can call <hi>Jeſus Lord, but by the ſpirit</hi> (as it is 1 Cor. 12.3. Then none could be convinced ſo far of ſin, for not receiving of, or beleeving in (which is all one) this Lord Chriſt, but by the Holy Ghoſt. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What is the great principle upon which you are moſt convicted:</hi> Is it <hi>SENSE,</hi> or <hi>HOPE of divine love.</hi> It may be thou haſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120075:42"/>ſometimes <hi>taſted how good the Lord is:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure you have had ſome <hi>ſence of the love of God,</hi> Or, It may be you have only ſometimes attained ſome <hi>hopes of divine loves:</hi> Now is it this, that doth moſt affect thy heart, in thy conviction. Doth not thy ſoule ſay, Oh! what a vile wretch have I been, who have deſpiſed <hi>the riches of Gods goodneſſe!</hi> and who have not <hi>been led thereby unto repentance:</hi> Standeſt thou convinced of the <hi>greatneſſe of ſins,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>greatneſſe of his love.</hi> Becauſe God hath been, is, and (thou hopeſt) will be <hi>exceeding good;</hi> Art not upon this convinced that thou art and haſt been <hi>exceeding bad?</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much as <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> hath had an influence upon thy conviction, ſo much the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath been in it. The <hi>hand of wrath</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a <hi>Pharoah</hi> that he hath ſinned; but an <hi>eye of love,</hi> will make a <hi>Peter</hi> weep bitterly. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>In thy convictions for ſin, what ſight haſt thou had of Chriſt?</hi> The ſpirit where he convinceth of ſin, he alſo <hi>convinceth of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> as tis <hi>John</hi> 16.10. i.e. the ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the ſoule, that albeit it is unrighteous; yet there is a righteouſneſſe in Chriſt, which it may have. The ſpirit, where he is a <hi>meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſin</hi> (comming in and convincing the ſoule thereof) he is alſo an <hi>Interpreter</hi> (taking the things of Chriſt, and ſo ſhewing thereof unto the ſoule) the ſpirit is, that <hi>one of a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his uprightneſſe.</hi> (as tis <hi>Job</hi> 33.23.) An hypocrite may be convinced by the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:120075:42"/>Law, but alas! in that conviction he ſees on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Moſes:</hi> But a Saint is convinced not only by the <hi>Law</hi> but the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> and therefore in his conviction he ſees a <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Canſt not thou ſay (O ſoul) when thou wert convinced, that thou wert a <hi>ſinner,</hi> thou wert alſo convinced that there was a <hi>Saviour?</hi> Didſt not thou ſee a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> as well as a <hi>diſeaſe?</hi> a healing <hi>plaiſter,</hi> as well as a killing <hi>wound.</hi> A <hi>Saviour,</hi> as well <hi>beſeeching</hi> ſinners to come unto him, that they might have life; as <hi>blaming</hi> of them, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in him, that they might be free from death. Surely (ſoule) its the <hi>ſpirit who giveth life, the letter killeth.</hi> Where the <hi>letter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth only, it doth leave a ſoule under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death: But if together with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death for ſin, thou didſt alſo ſee the hopes of life, in a righteouſneſſe; then there was ſomething more, and higher then the <hi>letter</hi> in thy conviction; even the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>If then when thou wert convinced, thou didſt <hi>ſee unbeleife as the great ſin, and divine love as the great aggravation of that unbeleife; and yet withall, a ſight of free and full righteouſneſſe tendred as a cure of both:</hi> If (I ſay) thou didſt ſee theſe things in thy conviction; why art thou caſt down O ſoule? and why doſt thou fear the ſpirit was not in thy conviction? To go on then to the laſt branch of this fear and doubt.</p>
               <p>Thou ſayſt (O ſoul) that doſt fear, <hi>thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was not from the ſpirit:</hi> At leſt, thou ſayſt, thou doſt doubt it. Its true, after thy <hi>ſtorme,</hi> thou didſt heare a <hi>ſtill voyce,</hi> but (ſayſt thou)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120075:43"/>was the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in that voyce? Sometimes even after conviction, thou doſt ſay thou didſt feel <hi>comfort,</hi> but thou feareſt whether it were from the <hi>ſpirit, or from the letter and fancy, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why now in order to the ſcattering of this fear, let me intreate you to conſider theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Whence it was that thy comfort was fetched, which was brought to thee?</hi> was it not ſuch as <hi>one of a thouſand</hi> could not bring? came it not from Jeſus Chriſt, who can only give <hi>man his righteouſneſſe?</hi> as it is <hi>Job</hi> 33, 23. He ſhall take of <hi>mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt of the ſpirit) <hi>Job.</hi> 16.15. Where the ſpirit brings in comfort, it is ſtill ſhewed to be fetched from Chriſt. Alas! canſt not thou ſay, It was not from any <hi>creature</hi> (men or Angell) that the hope of your comfort came (Alas! miſerable <hi>Comforters were they all.</hi>) But it was onely from Chriſt: where the ſpirit comforts, he doth it ſtill in a diſcovery of Chriſt. As he ſhewes Chriſt pierced by the ſoule, and uſeth that ſight unto <hi>conviction:</hi> ſo he diſcovers Chriſt willing to imbrace the ſoul, and uſeth this ſight unto <hi>conſolation.</hi> The peace and comfort of ſome, is rather from a <hi>ceſſation of the trouble of conſcience, then from a ſight, and diſcovery of Chriſt.</hi> Now if thy comfort came only from an apprehenſion of Chriſt, and from a ſight of the things in him; why art thou diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted as if thy comfort were not from the ſpirit? Since, as <hi>no man knoweth the things of a man,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120075:43"/>ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11</note> 
                  <hi>Even ſo, the things of Chriſt knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of Chriſt.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>How is thy comfort brought in?</hi> Is it from Chriſt, in a <hi>free word of grace, offering himſelfe to ſinners:</hi> or is it (as I may ſay) from a Chriſt <hi>fetcht in by ſome performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thine?</hi> Certainly, the leſſe of <hi>ſelf</hi> in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts comming into the ſoule, the more of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the comfort that ariſeth thereupon. Some ſoules have their comfort fetcht in rather by <hi>ſelfe in Chriſt,</hi> (i.e. what they ſee of themſelves, in the way of Chriſts comming in) then by <hi>Chriſt in himſelfe:</hi> My meaning is, ſome ſoules cannot be comforted in Chriſt, unleſſe they ſee Chriſt (as it were fetched and) comming in by their <hi>Humiliations, Repentings, Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. Oh if they can upon them, or in them, ſee a Chriſt comming in, they can be comforted: This comfort I ſuſpect is legall. But now if thou canſt ſay, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as it came from Chriſt, ſo it came, and comes ſtill from Chriſt, held forth <hi>purely in a word of grace;</hi> and that, when thou couldeſt ſee nothing of ſeife, to fetch in Chriſt: that then in a promiſe of free grace <hi>(as that he dyed for, and juſtifies the ungodly)</hi> when (I ſay) then, thou wert inabled to receive comfort from Chriſt, ſo brought it, <hi>without any ſelfe-quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,</hi> or <hi>performances:</hi> Surely, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is in, and by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> for ſtill the leſſe of ſelfe, the more of him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whereunto doth thy comfort tend?</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:120075:44"/>Confider this: Tends it to a <hi>magnifying of Chriſt, to a love and labour unto holineſſe?</hi> or tends it to <hi>ſelfe glorying,</hi> and a kind of <hi>wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi> Pray mind it; If thy comfort have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tendance to <hi>magnifie ſelfe</hi> (as if it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) or to leſſen ſin (as if it were nothing:) thou haſt cauſe to ſuſpect thy comfort is not of the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> For the <hi>very hopes</hi> of comfort by him tends unto <hi>purifying</hi> (<hi>Be that hath this hope puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himſelfe,</hi> &amp;c.) But now if upon any <hi>laſte,</hi> or <hi>hope</hi> of comfort from Chriſt; thy ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to admire him in <hi>his infinite love,</hi> for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thee: And to abhor ſin for provoking him: If thy ſoule is much in <hi>adoring him,</hi> and not a little in <hi>abhorring of ſolfe.</hi> If ſence of comfort do make thee melt as it were into a <hi>Chriſt-loving,</hi> and <hi>Sin-loathing</hi> frame: and make thee ſtudy what maner of converſation thou ſhouldeſt have for that comfort which thou haſt had. Surely if this be the fruit of thy comfort, thou needeſt not fear, but that thy comfort is a fruit of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Thus I have offered ſomething in particular, in order to the raiſing of ſuch ſoules as are caſt down, and feare that their <hi>call, conviction and comfort</hi> is not, was not of, or by the Spirit. To this I will adde ſome things by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration joyntly, ith reference to the whole. As now,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Whatſoever thy call, conviction, and comfort be, its precious, and to be prized.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be only in the <hi>letter,</hi> (as thou ſayſt) yet in caſe it be at all tis <hi>precious.</hi> How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120075:44"/>are there, that no way had either <hi>call, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> or <hi>comfort?</hi> But live and lye in ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>calls,</hi> or <hi>conviction;</hi> and never queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>comfort,</hi> go in <hi>mirth</hi> (as <hi>Jobs</hi> phraſe is) in a moment downe to <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 21.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Though your call, conviction and comfort be as yet but common, it may be ere long ſpeciall.</hi> That which is firſt, is not alwayes <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but that which is naturall, and afterward that which is ſpirituall</hi> (as it is 1 Cor. 15.46.) Chriſt many times doth <hi>ingraft</hi> (as ſome Divines ſay) <hi>grace upon nature.</hi> Often times Chriſt, <hi>ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeth,</hi> (as I may ſay) and <hi>ſpirituallizeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon workings,</hi> ſuch as at firſt have only been wrought upon in the <hi>letter,</hi> have afterwards beene wrought on by the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> Beſides this;</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider, if at preſent thy ſoule be brought up to cloſe with Chriſt, that now thou hangeſt as it were about his feet: mourning onely for the want of his ſmiles, waiting only for the diſcoveries of his loves:</hi> If now thy ſoule can ſay: I ſee a need of Chriſt, I am convinced of the want of a Chriſt; I onely pant after, and look for the injoyment of a Chriſt: &amp; all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that I have, all the ſupport of my ſpirit, lyes upon this, that I hope, he that ſhal come, wil come and will not tarry, and that the Lord whom thou lookeſt for, will ſuddenly come: If (I ſay) this be the <hi>[preſent frame]</hi> of thy ſpirit, (and ſpeake ſoule, is it not ſo?) why then art thou diſquieted? why art thou caſt down? why
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120075:45"/>doſt thou diſturbe thy ſelfe with this fear, that thy <hi>call, conviction,</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> is not of the ſpirit? Certainly, when, and where Chriſt is ſo <hi>diſcovered to be all in all,</hi> and ſo preſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſoul need not caſt down it ſelfe with feare.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>What it is which in truth doth act them, and carry them on in the things of Chriſt?</hi> Is it only their <hi>head,</hi> or is it not principally their <hi>heart?</hi> Education doth ſeldome ingage <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</hi> It may, and doth bring into a <hi>cuſtome,</hi> and this it doth meerly upon <hi>head-principall,</hi> i.e. a knowledge that ſuch or ſuch a duty is to be done, and that <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Tutors</hi> have done it &amp;c.

Now then ſuppoſe thy Parents and Tutor's dead: nay, ſuppoſe ſuch a ſad thing, that all of thy relations were enemyes to the wayes of Chriſt, and that they ſhould and did hate, at leſt ſlight, and ſcorn all that were godly. Upon this aske thy heart what it would or doth ſay to this; Is not the very ſuppoſition of this ſad to thy ſoule? And doth not thy ſoule ſay: Oh that thou couldſt weepe teares of blood over the ſoules of thy relations? Does not thy heart ſay, however they are, or doe, yet thou, <hi>and thy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120075:46"/>houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Doth not the ſpirit (upon thy appeale) bear witneſſe with thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that let Father, Mother, Husband, Wife, Maſter, &amp;c. do what they will, yet thou (by the helpe of Chriſt) will pray for them, and with full purpoſe of heart will cleave to him. Now if it be ſo, why art thou caſt down? why art thou affraid, that thou haſt no more then <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely a ſoul thus quallified (as I have hinted) goes far beyond <hi>education.</hi> If thou hadſt nothing but what thou hadſt from thy relations in edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, thou couldeſt not act further or againſt them (as is ſuppoſed) in Religion. Therefore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider O ſoule (that ſayſt thou feareſt thou haſt no more then education,) I ſay conſider, <hi>canſt not thou ſay, that albeit educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did firſt ſet thee in the way of godlineſſe: yet ſince that time, thy ſoule hath met with that which would have done it</hi> (if that had not?) and doth exceedingly confirme thee in it. Education is (or may bee) likened to that report which the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman made to her neighbours of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> Tis true, her report brings them to Chriſt, but Chriſts words confirmed them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as that they told her, <hi>now we beleeve, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves;</hi> ſo canſt not thou ſay: Tis true, all that at firſt thou hadſt was but Education; that is, that which thou hadſt from Parents, Friends, &amp;c. But now thou haſt ſomething more; now thou canſt ſay thou loveſt Chriſt and his wayes; not becauſe thou wert brought up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:120075:46"/>of him and his wayes; but becauſe thou haſt ſince taſted him to be ſweet, and found his ways pleaſant. I doubt not but that many ſoules can ſay this, and why then are they diſquieted for feare they have no more then education?</p>
               <p>To come up therefore one ſtep further in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the quieting of ſouls caſt down; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with this fear, I ſhall offer ſome three Inquiries unto them. As now</p>
               <p>Firſt, In caſe you ſhould deſiſt, and leave off from the wayes of Chriſt in which you have been educated: Inquire, <hi>what would your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be, and how your heart would take it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See, would, or could your heart be quiet:</hi> Should you (thinke ye) be in a comfortable condition. Nay, doth not the feare of <hi>apoſtacy</hi> trouble you? Doe not you tremble to thinke leſt you ſhould <hi>fall?</hi> Surely, had you no more then <hi>education,</hi> you would not bee perplexed with theſe thoughts. Its all one to a <hi>Jacke</hi> wound up by a mans hand, whether it move, or ſtand ſtill; and its all one to one principled no higher then education, whether he prayes or no, heares or no &amp;c. if the hand of <hi>educatiours wind him not up,</hi> he can bee quiet and ſtill; But where life is, there motion muſt bee, otherwiſe the creature <hi>groanes:</hi> And ſurely, if upon an inquiry this way, thou find <hi>ceſſation,</hi> or <hi>apoſtacy</hi> would be as <hi>death</hi> to thee, thou needſt not much feare, but there is a life of regeneration, and ſomething higher then education in thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Inquire what thy thoughts are upon doing of holy duties: are thy thoughts then ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwolne,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:120075:47"/>i.e. art conceited of ſelfe,<note place="margin">Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> as ſome great one: or rather doſt not ſee, thou art an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant?</hi> and haſt done but what (nay, not ſo much as) thou <hi>oughteſt?</hi> Surely, though education may, and do puffe up, yet its rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that humbles and pulls down. Adde hereunto</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Make inquiry after thy aime in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actings.</hi> Is it to be, and do as others? is it to comply with friends, relations, &amp;c. or is it to have communion with Chriſt? Is it to hold forth the <hi>praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſſe to light?</hi> Is not this thy aime to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy ſelfe to God? Its true, education may, and doth make many do duties, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves to Parents, Tutors, &amp;c. But its regeneration, which makes this the end of holy actings, to approve on's ſoule to God. Education, may cauſe a miniſter to preach, and a Chriſtian to practiſe, to be approved of by men: But its regeneration which puts on <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to ſtudy to ſhew himſelfe <hi>approved unto God.</hi> as tis 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Wherefore O ſoule why art thou caſt down? why ſayeſt or feareſt thou, that all which thou haſt is onely education? Sith if thou <hi>ſhouldeſt leave off, thou couldſt not be quiet:</hi> And yet <hi>while thou acteſt, thou dareſt not boaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and all that thou aimeſt at, is <hi>above men:</hi> Surely, theſe things, are more then education, But</p>
               <p>To adde one thing more: <hi>Suppoſe it be as thou feareſt:</hi> Suppoſe as yet education is thy all, and that all thy principles are parentine: I ſay ſuppoſe this,</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:120075:47"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What then, what if thy feare bee more then a feare, a reallity, what then Oh ſoule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? why then I may well ſit ſadly, as I do, and be <hi>diſquieted</hi> more then I am, I may not onely be <hi>caſt down,</hi> but reſolve never to riſe; why, if I have no more then edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation wo is me! for I am undone, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply. Stay ſoul! not ſo ſad!</hi> If it ſhould be that as yet you have no more then education, yet remember,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Good actings are laudable in themſelves.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſes are commendable from any princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: The <hi>young man</hi> that told Chriſt he had <hi>kept all the commandements from his childhood;</hi> had no more then education: and yet tis ſaid, Chriſt looked upon him, <hi>and loved him,</hi> Mark. 10.21. I thinke it was but a conceit of <hi>Origen,</hi> that ſaid <hi>Chriſt kiſſed him:</hi> yet I thinke it may be truly <hi>collected,</hi> Chriſt was pleaſed with his practiſe, though he pittied <hi>his principles:</hi> your actings are <hi>laudable and lovely,</hi> though your <hi>principles</hi> be as yet but very <hi>low:</hi> And beſides this, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt can raiſe your principles up to your actings when he pleaſeth.</hi> Do you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with <hi>open ſayles,</hi> though <hi>rowing</hi> and <hi>lugging</hi> with the <hi>Oares</hi> of <hi>education:</hi> The <hi>ſpirit blowes where, and when he liſteth.</hi> He may <hi>principle</hi> thy actions, and fill thy <hi>ſailes</hi> (ere thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware) you know who ſaid, <hi>ere ever I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, my ſoul made me like the chariots of my wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling people,</hi> Cant. 6.12. I will not ſay <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:120075:48"/>had grace, and was ſanctified from the <hi>womb,</hi> yet I know he was well <hi>educated,</hi> his <hi>unfained faith</hi> firſt dwelt in his <hi>Grandmother Lois,</hi> and in his <hi>mother Eunice</hi> (as tis 2 Tim. 1.5.) <hi>Chriſt ſanctified his education, and why may be not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then art thou diſquieted (O ſoule) as fearing thou haſt no more then <hi>education?</hi> It may be but a <hi>feare:</hi> or if it ſhould be <hi>reall,</hi> yet there is you ſee, <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> for this thing.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Its at leſt a peece or part of ſincerity, to queſtion hypocriſie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</note> Hypocrites doe not uſe to queſtion themſelves: Its the very <hi>nature of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> to be <hi>ſhye of,</hi> and to <hi>avoid</hi> (as much as poſſible) any <hi>tryall:</hi> And its of the nature of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to be queſtioning. Thy very feare (O ſoule) of <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> is a fruit of <hi>ſincerity.</hi> The <hi>Phariſee</hi> did not <hi>ſuſpect himſelfe:</hi> neither did the <hi>Publican purge himſelfe:</hi> yet you know who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:120075:48"/>went <hi>away juſtified.</hi> Chriſt (O ſoule) will and (indeed delights to) juſtifie ſuch as condemne themſelves. Thine own ſuſpition is not an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thy <hi>hypocriſie.</hi> Look as wicked men are ſaid to feare <hi>where no feare</hi> (i.e. no ground of feare) <hi>is:</hi> So likewiſe Saints do ſometimes.<note place="margin">Cant. 1.6.</note> Its worth the noting though the Church cry out <hi>looke not upon mee becauſe I am blacke:</hi> (much like the Leper in the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.45.) yet Chriſt ſaith of her <hi>thou art all faire and haſt no ſpot.</hi> Chriſt (O ſoule) can diſcover <hi>ſparkles of gold</hi> under thy <hi>clods of dirt;</hi> and he can ſee <hi>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſincerity,</hi> even in thy <hi>feares of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>An unknown iniquity, is not an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hypocriſie.</hi> Sinne muſt be <hi>known,</hi> and yet <hi>concealed,</hi> ere it brand one for an <hi>hypocrite.</hi> Many ſoules queſtion their ſincerity becauſe of <hi>ſecret ſins.</hi> Peradventure ſome corruption bubbles up that they were not aware of; they perceive ſome ſin that had a long time laine ſecret, and this makes them feare they are <hi>hypocrites,</hi> but it ſhould not. <hi>David</hi> is ſenſible of <hi>ſecret ſins,</hi> and he cryes out againſt them, <hi>cleanſe me from my ſecret ſins,</hi> Pſal. 19. Yet he can and doth ſtand to, and plead his <hi>ſincerity,</hi> Pſal. 26.1; 2. Look as in point of <hi>ſincerity,</hi> its not enough to ſerve God by doing his will: But we muſt <hi>know</hi> it, and be willing our ſelves. So likewiſe in the point of hypocriſie, its not <hi>ſimple ſinning,</hi> but <hi>knowing and hiding</hi> thereof that makes it ſo, The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was <hi>Gods rod,</hi> and he did ſerve him; <hi>Howbeit</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>he meaneth not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:120075:49"/>ſo, neither doth his heart thinke ſo,</hi> Eſa. 10.7. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſervice was not ſincere, for he nere <hi>meant</hi> to doe what he did; Proportionably, thy ſins O ſoule are not hypocriſie, for as much as thou <hi>kneweſt them not,</hi> neither didſt mean to <hi>keep them</hi> if thou didſt know them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Conſider this (O ſad dejected ſoul) thy ſins which are newly broke out, are they not ſuch as thou didſt never dreame of: Is it not that which thy ſoule loatheth; and thou didſt thinke thy ſelfe moſt free from?</p>
               <p>Anſ: <hi>Yes, They are ſo, and this makes me fear my heart, that it ſhould ſo long conceale theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which now I ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> But know O ſoule, <hi>its a miſtake from hence</hi> to conclude hypocriſie; Certainly thy <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> will <hi>excuſe</hi> thee herein: Hypocriſie is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a <hi>feighning or counterfeiting either of vertue where tis not, or a concealing of vice where it is.</hi> Didſt ever <hi>boaſt</hi> or feigne thy ſelfe <hi>better,</hi> then conſcience told thee thou wert? or didſt ever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,</hi> or <hi>extenuate</hi> ſins thou kneweſt in thee? If not, why feareſt thou thy ſelf an hypocrite? Its a <hi>paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Sepulcher,</hi> that denotes hypocriſie, there may be unknowne ſins, where there is ſincerity. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Some mixtures of this bitterneſſe will be in the beſt, while in the body.</hi> There is no grace ſo perfect in this life, as that its free from all <hi>mixture:</hi> Our <hi>gold</hi> is never ſo <hi>refined,</hi> but that there will (at leſt) cleave to us ſome <hi>droſſe.</hi> As the <hi>ſtrongeſt faith</hi> doth not free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from all <hi>incredulity:</hi> So the <hi>pureſt ſincerity</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:120075:49"/>doth not free from ſome hypocriſie. Even <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are taxed by <hi>Paul,</hi> and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſpirit no have had (at leſt) a tange of this <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> they are down-right charged with <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> Gal. 2.13.

                  <note place="margin">Torſhall.</note> 
                  <hi>but with ſo great a difference, that all are not to be called hypocriſes.</hi> You will not call every <hi>doubting ſoule</hi> an <hi>Infidell:</hi> why ſhould you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome <hi>remainders of hypocriſie,</hi> conclude your ſelves hypocrites? <hi>Job</hi> is charged (even by God himſelfe) to <hi>darken counſell by words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 38.2.</note> And yet God tells Satan, that he was a <hi>perfect and upright man.</hi> But ſuppoſe the worſt (O doubting ſoule) ſuppoſe not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but a great deal of hypocriſie, be in thy heart. Conſider,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Our happineſſe is built and bottomed more, and rather upon the ſincerity of Chriſts heart to us, then upon the ſincerity of our hearts to him.</hi> Chriſt knew before he loved us, that we <hi>would deale treacherouſly</hi> (as it is <hi>Eſa.</hi> 48.8.) Its charged upon the Church that ſhe was not as <hi>ſincere.</hi> (As <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes a wife,<note place="margin">Pro. 31.11</note> i.e. to be one in whom the heart <hi>of her husband might truſt</hi>) the Lord ſaid of <hi>Iudab</hi> ſhe was <hi>treacherous,</hi> and her heart was not turned wholly but <hi>[fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly]</hi> to him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.10. Yet he ſaith unto her <hi>I am married unto thee,</hi> verſ. 14. Its our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Chriſt <hi>abideth faithfull</hi> (as tis 2 Tim. 2.13.) our welfare is not founded upon our own hearts; but upon his: And as the <hi>whole body</hi> of ſin, and hypocriſie, did not keep him from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:120075:50"/>loving us ſincerely at firſt, ſo the remainders of hypocriſie ſhall not make him to love us leſſe now. Reader, if thou be not a <hi>Spider,</hi> I may tell thee this, Chriſt can, <hi>and doth love hypocrites:</hi> His heart is ſincere, though our hearts be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>i.e.</hi> one that ſucks poiſon out of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome things.</note> Sucke the ſpeech, and if thou bee a <hi>Bee,</hi> thou wilt find not onely <hi>ſweetneſſe,</hi> but <hi>ſanctity,</hi> yea and <hi>ſincerity</hi> in it too. Rouze up O caſt downe ſoule; Chriſt hath writ his love, and thy life upon his owne heart, not on thine; There it remaines ſound, notwithſtanding thy <hi>rottenneſſe.</hi> The fountaine of free grace is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen even for <hi>adulterous Iudah, and treacherous Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Yea, but yet my hypocriſie is <hi>odious</hi> is it not? my <hi>double dealing</hi> with Chriſt is <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in it ſelfe. I am ſure it <hi>is ſo to me:</hi> I ſee it, and while I ſee it, I cannot but be ſad. <hi>If it bee Chriſts glory that his heart is ſincere towards me? the more its my ſin, and ſhame, and ſorrow, that my heart is not ſo towards him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Tis ſo indeed;</hi> but alas, <hi>I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet not received: and therefore my joy is not full.</hi> I have groaned under this hypocriſie many yeares: And yet ſee not the promiſe of the comming of Chriſts ſpirit, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Now for the ſatisfaction of ſuch ſouls, and in order to the lifting up of their dejected ſpirits, I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120075:51"/>would offer, &amp; have them to conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This combate may conſiſt with,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ever is with a ſtate of grace.</hi> Its the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome to think, and ſay, that their conqueſt is compleate, and that they are in perfect quiet. Surely, (I ſay) theſe words are rather diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of weakneſſe, then of ſtrength, and perfection. <hi>Iſrael was not at reſt, when in Canaan:</hi> Neither are thoſe ſoules who are troubled with, and for ſinnes, in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Its not an <hi>Iſraelitiſh ſpirit,</hi> to ſay either others, or our ſelves are in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe we have ſtill <hi>combatings.</hi> Even in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> they had their <hi>combatings.</hi> God left ſome there, to keep his people in action. Doe not thinke, eſpecially do not conclude thou art ſtill in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe thou art not freed from <hi>fightings,</hi> and feares. Beleive (O ſoule) thou mayeſt be <hi>in the land of promiſe,</hi> and yet be troubled with the combates. For</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Even choyce Saints have been as you are,</hi> i.e. peſtered with corruptions, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with fear of conqueſt. <hi>Paul</hi> had been as high as any <hi>(even in the third heavens)</hi> and yet he had his <hi>buffettings,</hi> yea, and he crys out of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again, You think your ſelves ſometimes in a ſadder eſtate then any: And you ſay, <hi>were ever any ſo wretched as you are?</hi> Yes, O ſoule! <hi>Paul,</hi> even <hi>Paul</hi> who came <hi>behind none;</hi> nay, who was before any in grace, and guifts, he was as <hi>wretched as you are;</hi> And he crys out ſo, <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am!</hi> Marke, <hi>that I am</hi> (as if none other were as he.) Its a comfortable, and raiſing thought, O ye caſt downe ſoules; <hi>Other choyce
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120075:52"/>Saints have been in as wretched a condition as you are, by reaſon of the combatings of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider, its <hi>a rich mercy to have a heart to ſtrive with, and to be affraid of corruption.</hi> Many a wretch is at peace <hi>with ſin;</hi> yea, many are in <hi>Covenant with hell and death.</hi> Some there be who are ſo far from fighting with, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of corruption, that they pay <hi>tribute</hi> to it, and make <hi>proviſion for it.</hi> Many a wretch is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conquered captive unto ſin. And its mercy that you have a heart to ſtrive. Time was when you were free <hi>from righteouſneſſe</hi> (i.e. had none at all) and then you ſerved ſin. Its grace that now you do oppoſe it, and deny to yeeld ſervice to it. Were you at peace with <hi>ſin,</hi> you might feare your <hi>enmity with God.</hi> But being at <hi>warre</hi> with it, you may have <hi>peace</hi> in him. But.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>As long as your ſoul is kept up in a ſtriving way, its a ſign of ſtrength.</hi> Why ſhould you ſay, you are weake, and feare &amp;c. ſith you are ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> as to <hi>fight. Weake</hi> ones are not <hi>fighters:</hi> had you not ſome divine ſtrength, you could not ſtand before corruption: But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are (after long <hi>fighting</hi>) able <hi>yet</hi> to ſtand, and <hi>ſtrive,</hi> why are you caſt downe, as if you ſhould not get the day? Conſider (O dejected ſoul) that it argues a <hi>tree to be well rooted, that ſtands after much blowing;</hi> And its a ſigne of a ſtrong and <hi>valiant ſouldier,</hi> if he keepe to his ground and flinch not, notwithſtanding great combating. And certainly, it may argue unto
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:120075:52"/>thee, that (through Chriſt) thou art <hi>yet ſtrong;</hi> In as much as ſtill thou art able to ſtrive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Oh but I feare <hi>for future</hi> (thou wilt ſay) becauſe (as yet) ſin ſtands ſtrong, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all I doe againſt it, I feare I ſhall never, after all my ſtriving, get the victory over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> But why (O ſoule) ſhouldſt thou thus feare? Peradventure as yet, thou haſt not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted unto blood, in ſtriving againſt ſin.</hi> Bear up yet a little longer, ſtrive yet ſtill, ſin will bleed, and fall ere long. For</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Conſider, Its no argument that you ſhall not conquer; becauſe as yet you have not.</hi> Thy ſoule may be victorious, though not yet. That party that is put hard to it at firſt, may come off with the conqueſt afterward. Its a certaine truth, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall get the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over all things: and that he ſhall bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing into ſubjection to himſelfe. But now <hi>we ſee not</hi> [yet] <hi>all things under him,</hi> Heb. 2.8. It were a ſaying <hi>fallacious</hi> at firſt hearing, to ſay Chriſt ſhall not put all things under him, becauſe as <hi>yet</hi> we do not <hi>now</hi> ſee it. What if as <hi>yet</hi> thou haſt not got the victory over corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Mayeſt not thou be a conqueror <hi>hereafter,</hi> although not <hi>new.</hi> Some that have been worſted in the <hi>morning,</hi> have yet been conquerers ere <hi>

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:120075:53"/>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>That your ſoul gets many a victory that you mind not.</hi> You rout ſin many a time, if you did but marke it.

               <p>THe ſeventh ſort of feares which fill the ſoule when its caſt downe, <hi>are about its cloſing with Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſe.</note> Some there are (as I noted) that (when they are caſt downe) cry out, Oh they fear! they never did truly cloſe with Chriſt in all their lives, at leſt in a ſaving way.

               <p>Now that I might ſatisfie ſuch ſoules, and raiſe them; I ſhall propoſe theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>

                  <hi>Its poſſible, to have cloſed with Chriſt, and yet to doubt it.</hi> All experienced Divines, and Chriſtians know, that <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>doubting</hi> may dwell together. Its true, faith <hi>(as faith)</hi> doth not doubt, but yet where <hi>faith is, there doubting may be,</hi> Experience witneſſeth to this, that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites may and doe thinke, they have cloſed with Chriſt, when they have not: And why ſhould not we conceive as well on the other hard; that Saints may have cloſed with Chriſt, and yet think they have not? It may indeed be queſtioned, whether the ſoule doth act faith, and know it not: But I thinke it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120075:54"/>but that the ſoule may have faith, and not act it. Peradventure, its not poſſible in the <hi>act of cloſing,</hi> to be <hi>ignorant</hi> thereof; But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly after <hi>the act,</hi> tis poſſible to doubt. Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the ſoule may queſtion, whether that <hi>act were right.</hi> I do not fear to lay downe this as an undenyable truth, <hi>that ſoules may have clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Chriſt, and yet doubt it.</hi> This is the firſt thing I propoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Its poſſible, that all the grounds upon which the ſoule queſtions its cloſing with Chriſt, may be weake and falſe.</hi> As the grounds upon which hypocrites conceit their faith to be good, may be, and are falſe, and inſufficient; So likewiſe the grounds upon which a ſound beleever may queſtion his faith as bad, may be fallible and falſe too. In this caſe a Saints <hi>feare,</hi> and an hypocrites <hi>preſumption, may be both alike groundleſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe grounds I find amongſt others, as the main of this feare.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Want of aſſurance.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut a not cloſing with Chriſt.</hi> Aſſurance is rather a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:120075:55"/>i.e. a thing that followes; then a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant,</hi> i.e. a thing that goes with our cloſing with Chriſt. I know ſome that make <hi>aſſurance and faith</hi> all one: But as yet I am unconvinced of any thing that might make that good, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoule that hath cloſed with Chriſt is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereof. I can perſwade my ſelfe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have cloſed with Chriſt, who yet cannot ſay they have aſſurance, nay, who cry out thus, they doubt they never cloſed with Chriſt. Many ſoules ſay indeed, they fear they never cloſed with Chriſt becauſe they want aſſurance. O ſay they, could we doubt ſo much, if we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; had we cloſed with Chriſt aright, we ſhould have been aſſured of ſalvation, long ere this &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſurely, the ſoules miſtake, 1 <hi>themſelves,</hi> and 2 <hi>aſſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, They <hi>miſtake themſelves,</hi> in that they thinke aſſurance is an <hi>act of theirs. Its a part of the ſpirits ſealing, not of their cloſing.</hi> Its true, he that beleeveth hath the witneſſe in himſelfe as tis 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10. But that witneſſe is, <hi>that God is true, in what he ſaith of Chriſt</hi> (as is clear by the context there) but its not this aſſurance, that really I have cloſed with, and am one with Jeſus Chriſt. Yea,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They miſtake aſſurance,</hi> in that they make it the <hi>formallity of faith,</hi> which is rather a <hi>fruit.</hi> Faith is this, That the ſoule fully belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a free tender of Chriſt to ſinners, goes forth, to cloſe with, and rely upon Chriſt. Its not an aſſurance of an intereſt in Chriſt, that is the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:120075:55"/>not the <hi>act</hi> of cloſing. So that its not ground enough for thee (O ſoule) to doubt thy aright cloſing with Chriſt, becauſe thou wanteſt aſſurance. No nor</p>
               <p>Secondly, Its <hi>not ground enough for thee to doubt thy cloſing with Chriſt, becauſe of his not ſmiling upon thee.</hi> Verily, (ſay ſome poor deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoules) we never as yet did in a right way cloſe with Chriſt: for he never as yet ſmiled on us. Ah! his ſmiles are our life: but alas! we ſee not them, and therefore we cannot but que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion our cloſing with him.</p>
               <p>But this is not a ſufficient ground, for the one may be, without the other. <hi>The child may truly hang about the mothers necke, and yet ſhe not kiſſe it.</hi> Yea, and the mother may ſincerely love, though ſhe do not ſmilingly look upon the child. Chriſt called the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> a <hi>dog;</hi> and yet he loved her as a <hi>lamb:</hi> ſhe beleeved, and cloſed with him (to ſuch a height that he ſaid, ſhe had <hi>great faith</hi>) and yet notwithſtanding, Chriſt ſmiled not upon her (at leſt) at firſt. Thou mayſt have cloſed with, though as yet thou ſeeſt not a ſmile in the face of Chriſt towards thee. Do not queſtion thy cloſing with him, for want of his ſmiling upon thee. No neither</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Its not your inabillity to truſt Chriſt for other things, that ſhould make you queſtion your cloſing with him.</hi> I doe not doubt but that <hi>David</hi> did truſt God for the life of his ſoule, when yet he did not for the life of his body: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he ſaid <hi>he ſhould one day fall</hi> (i.e. dye) <hi>by the hand of Saul.</hi> Yet certainly, he had and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:120075:56"/>did cloſe with Chriſt for his ſoule. The promiſe holding forth Chriſt, is <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>full:</hi> the promiſe holding forth the creature, is oft <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall</hi> and <hi>ſhort:</hi> The ſoul may cloſe with the one, and not with the other. A ſoule may not be able to cloſe with a promiſe for <hi>life, health, ſafety, wealth,</hi> &amp;c. and yet he may cloſe with a promiſe of Chriſt. Hee hath not the ſame ground for the one, that he hath for the other Nay,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Some kind of blaſphemous thoughts of Chriſt, are not a ſufficient ground to queſtion our cloſing with Chriſt.</hi> Satan may indeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſt <hi>ugly</hi> to the ſoule, that cloſeth with him as <hi>beautifull.</hi> Why ſhould a ſoule think, that Satan may not as well make it queſtion whether Chriſt <hi>be the ſon of God: as he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make Chriſt himſelfe to doubt it.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a precious heart,<note place="margin">Note this ye deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearts!</note> who hath high thoughts of Chriſt as precious; may yet upon Satans injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be tempted to queſtion his <hi>deity.</hi> But why ſhould they queſtion their cloſing with Chriſt, upon Satans ſuggeſtions?

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, It only <hi>ſecures the ſoule from clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them.</hi> Its one thing to <hi>have,</hi> another thing to <hi>cloſe</hi> with <hi>blaſphemous thoughts.</hi> The ſoule that is cloſed with Chriſt, will not cloſe with blaſphemous thoughts (no more doſt thou O ſoul, doſt thou? are <hi>they not as a dagger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart.</hi>) What though Satan ſpeak ill of thy husband Chriſt to thee; ſhall <hi>his</hi> blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (for its not <hi>thine</hi>) make thee queſtion thy <hi>faith?</hi> Why then art thou caſt down upon that, as if thou didſt not, haſt not cloſed with him? But to paſſe from this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I would intreate ſoules caſt down, and doubting their cloſing with Chriſt, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>What right cloſing with Chriſt is.</hi> Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, its this: For the ſoule upon <hi>the ſight of a neceſſity of Chriſt, to go out to cloſe with, or to caſt its ſelfe upon Chriſt, as freely tendred.</hi> Saith the poor ſoule, I ſee Chriſt <hi>tendred freely,</hi> and I am ſenſible I <hi>need him fully,</hi> hereupon I go and <hi>lye down at his feet.</hi> This is ſummarily to cloſe with him. You muſt remember to diſtinguiſh between <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>taſting</hi> of Chriſt; <hi>Taking is cloſing, taſting is comfort.</hi> The one is not the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:120075:57"/>other. It may be (O ſoule) thou haſt not as yet <hi>taſted</hi> Chriſt, yet thou mayſt have <hi>taken</hi> Chriſt. The woman that ſat at Chriſts feet weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had <hi>taken</hi> Chriſt (for Chriſt ſpeakes of her faith:) but ſhe did not <hi>taſt</hi> him, till he ſaid <hi>thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Weeping ſoules! you ſit at Chriſts <hi>feet,</hi> but it may be you have not as yet <hi>taſted</hi> his <hi>favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Learn to know that your cloſing with him for forgiveneſſe, is diſtinct from his ſaying to you, your ſinnes are forgiven. This conſideration (weighed) would much ſatisfie ſuch, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt downe, queſtion their cloſing with Chriſt. But to this I ſhall adde more. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Pray mind this, <hi>Our ſafety and welfare doth more, and rather depend upon Chriſts cloſing with us, then upon our cloſing with him</hi> And Chriſt knowes that, when we do not know this. Here is the <hi>ſureſt ſeale</hi> of our ſalvation, the <hi>Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Chriſt (Oh ſoul) cloſeth with thee, and he doth know it, though thou knoweſt not thy cloſing with him. <hi>The child is not ſo ſafe in holding about the mothers necke, as it is in being in the mothers armes.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt (O ye caſt down ſoules) holds you in his armes: and this is your ſafety. Suppoſe thou cannot ſee thy cloſing with him, yet he knowes his own cloſing with you: And his arme is ſtronger and ſurer to hold us to him, then ours are to hold him to us. Yea,</p>
               <p>Fiftly, I propoſe this alſo unto thee O ſoule, who art dejected, and queſtioneſt thy
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:120075:57"/>cloſing with Chriſt. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt muſt, and doth cloſe with us, ere wee can or do cloſe with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſhepherd muſt and doth goe after the ſheep, and not the ſheep after him. Chriſt is our ſhepherd, and he leaves the Ninty and nine ſheepe, to ſeeke thee one; and having found he layes it upon his ſhoulders. Did you ever hear of a loſt ſheep that ſought the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; and laid hold on the ſhepherd? <hi>you have not choſen me, but I have choſen you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. And the Apoſtle tels us, that he <hi>loved us firſt.</hi> Chriſt (O ſoule) is firſt in the action of cloſing: And he may be ſtretching forth his hand to cloſe with thee, though thou be not ſtretching forth to cloſe with him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, Suppoſe (O ſoule deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and caſt downe!) I ſay ſuppoſe it be as thou feareſt, that as <hi>yet,</hi> thou haſt not cloſed with Chriſt: <hi>What hinders but that thou mayest cloſe with him now?</hi> To day if you will heare his voyce, harden not your heart. He begs <hi>now,</hi> do thou cloſe now. Rouze up thy ſoule, and cloſe with Chriſt (even while thou readeſt) he ſtands with open <hi>armes, ready to imbrace thee,</hi> yea, and with <hi>open mouth</hi> (as I may ſay) calling after thee.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is it then that hinders?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This hinders (will you ſay) I fear <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe,</hi> and I find <hi>unableneſſe:</hi> I am neither <hi>filling</hi> nor <hi>able.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:120075:58"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> Why know (O ſoule) <hi>unworthineſſe</hi> ſhould not keep thee off, ſith he calls thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the man was <hi>blind when Chriſt called, ſhould be not go?</hi> This is that that makes Chriſts grace ſo worthy, that it cloſeth with ſuch as are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
               <p>And as to thy <hi>inability;</hi> know he'le helpe thee. <hi>The mother will ſtoop to take up the child in her armes, that cannot clime up to her necke.</hi> Chriſt (O ſoule) will help thee to cloſe with himſelfe. Do but <hi>look up to him,</hi> and tis don. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſayes he'le make his prayer <hi>and looke up.</hi> Do thou (O ſoul) Chriſt bids thee (and let that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thee.) <hi>Look unto me, and be ſaved,</hi> Eſa: 45.22. What canſt thou do leſſe? and behold! he requires no more. Wherefore then art thou caſt down? and why art thou diſquieted, O ſoul? Suppoſe that as yet (however conſidering that which hath been hinted, thou mayeſt have no cauſe to ſuppoſe it) but I ſay ſuppoſe it, that as yet thou haſt not cloſed with Chriſt, the <hi>doore of grace is yet open, and tis free for thee to do it now:</hi> Bee not therefore dejected, nor caſt downe, for as yet thou mayeſt cloſe with, and rejoyce in Jeſus Chriſt as thine.</p>

               <head type="sub">I mentioned in the former Section an Eighth feare, which diſcovers it ſelfe in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſoules and that was, <hi>A fear of denying Chriſt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Some poor caſt downe ſoules are much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with this fear: Oh ſay they,<note place="margin">Caſe.</note> ſhould we be brought up to the <hi>tryall,</hi> we ſhould <hi>deny Chriſt.</hi> Its true (ſay they) peradventure wee may never <hi>actually be brought</hi> unto it, yet its good to <hi>try our hearts;</hi> whether the love of Chriſt in us bee as ſtrong as death: And alas, upon the <hi>tryal,</hi> we ſee ground to <hi>ſuſpect it.</hi> Surely, we find we love our <hi>life,</hi> more then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and we feare we ſhould ſooner <hi>deny him,</hi> then <hi>dye for him.</hi> Thus do many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now for the quieting of ſouls in this fear; I ſhal offer theſe particulars very briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider,<note place="margin">Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</note> O ye dejected and fearfull ſoules! <hi>This fear of yours may be a companion of valour.</hi> Even ſuch as have been <hi>fearfull</hi> in the Town, have been <hi>valiant</hi> in the Field. As there are ſome who boaſt much, and do little; ſo there have been ſome, that have feared much and yet done mightily. Our Book of Martyrs tells us of two, One of which, <hi>boaſted how gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly he would burn,</hi> and yet he cowardly <hi>recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> the other <hi>feared he ſhould deny Chriſt,</hi> and yet he gloriouſly <hi>held out, and ſuffered death.</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:120075:59"/>You may fear, and yet when it comes to it, may be able to dye for Chriſt. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We are not able to tell what ſtrength Chriſt will give in at the very nicke of time.</hi> Chriſt makes good, promiſes, in their <hi>ſeaſon.</hi> As <hi>wiſdom</hi> to <hi>diſpute</hi> for, ſo <hi>courage</hi> to <hi>dye</hi> for Chriſt, hath its <hi>houre</hi> in which it ſhall be given. Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids his diſciples fearfull trouble, and care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand: (for ſo the word ſignifies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.14. And he tells them <hi>Mal.</hi> 10.19.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>it ſhall be given in that hour.</hi> Doe not caſt down thy ſelfe (O poore ſoule) but beleeve there is ſtrength in Chriſt though there be weaknes in thee: and thou mayſt experience that in the <hi>hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of tryall,</hi> which thou doubteſt now. If Chriſt call thee to dye, he'le keep thee from denyall. <hi>Why ſhould the Souldier have his armes bef-re the time of War?</hi> Your armes i.e. your ſtrength and courage to die for Chriſt, is reſerved for that houre, to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth then, why ſhouldeſt thou perplex thy ſelfe for want of it now. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Suppoſe thou ſhouldeſt flinch, and faint in a day of tryall.</hi> Suppoſe thou ſhouldeſt indeed fall ſo ſadly, (for tis a ſad fall) as to deny Chriſt. Yet know</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This might conſiſt with grace:</hi> I know none that will deny <hi>Peters</hi> grace, becauſe of his denyall of Chriſt. Yea,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This may conſiſt with love to Chriſt.</hi> There is a <hi>true love,</hi> which at firſt is not ſo ſtrong <hi>as death. Peter</hi> did not fall in the <hi>truth,</hi> but in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of his love. Beſides</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt will not let thee fall for ever.</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:120075:59"/>He will reſtore thee againe. He can and will <hi>bring thee on with courage in a ſecond tryall, who didſt fall away by cowardize in a firſt. Peter</hi> did afterward out-face a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> that at firſt was affraid of a <hi>Maid.</hi> To this adde</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt may own you, though you deny him.</hi> Its certaine, a denyall of Chriſt with <hi>feare and unwillingneſſe</hi> (and this is thy caſe O ſoul) doth not expoſe us to a <hi>being denyed by Chriſt;</hi> Its true, <hi>direct, voluntary, deſperate denying of Chriſt is dangerous: So,</hi> if we deny him he'le deny us. But a denyall through <hi>jear, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy:</hi> A denyall <hi>feared before it be, bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after it is</hi> (which is and would be thy caſe O ſoule) this I ſay doth not, ſhall not make Chriſt deny any.</p>
               <p>Why then art thou caſt downe O ſoule; and why art thou troubled with a feare of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt: Hee knowes how to <hi>ſtrengthen thee, that thou ſhalt not, and to pitty thee if thou doe, yea, and to owne thee;</hi> though for a time thou ſhouldeſt deny him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 9.</head>
               <head type="sub">Satisfaction for ſoules caſt downe about Prayer.</head>
               <p>BEſides thoſe eight particular feares, which I ſpake of in the ſixth Chapter of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Section; I added ſix other feares which do appeare in ſome dejected ſoules: Now its
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:120075:60"/>my deſire to ſpeake ſomething to them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſatisfie ſome ſoules that lye and labour under them.</p>
               <p>Some there are that when they are caſt downe, doe much diſquiet themſelves about their <hi>prayers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſe.</note> Oh ſay ſome, we feare we <hi>never prayed in all our lives, or if wee did, wee queſtion whether God ever heard us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſatisfaction of ſoules in this caſe, I ſhall ſpeake unto it in both its branches. And<note place="margin">Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, For ſuch ſoules as are caſt down and diſquieted, and cry out, Oh <hi>they never prayed in all their lives.</hi> Its true, they ſay, they have ſometimes ſpoke in prayer, but they doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever they prayed in prayer. They feare they rather moved <hi>their lips,</hi> then breathed <hi>their ſpirits,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There are theſe things which I would ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch ſouls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This very fear argues a choice frame:</hi> It proceeds from a very choyce ſpirit, thus to fear. Indeed a ſlight and common ſpirit doth pray it cares not how: So the worke be done, its all they mind (and it were well ſome mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much) But with what frame of ſpirit they pray (alas!) that they looke not after. Some there are that we call <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which in this are as bad as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that they rather give God a number of prayers, then any thing elſe: but now it argues a ſpirit ſomething heightened, to mind the manner of prayer; to eye the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the ſoul, how that is in prayer. Looke as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:120075:60"/>it argues in things humaine, an ordinary minde that can content it ſelfe with the bare doing of things, how <hi>bunglingly</hi> ſo ever, whereas it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a raiſedneſſe of mind, to ſee that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing be <hi>well done,</hi> as well as <hi>done:</hi> to ſee it be done neatly, &amp;c. So it argues in things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, a common ſpirit (ſuch an one as <hi>Caine</hi> had) to be contented with a bare ſacrifice, a bare empty prayer: But it diſcovers a ſpirit heightened (ſuch an one as Paul had) to eye the ſpirit, how it is in prayer. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth he would <hi>pray in his ſpirit, and with underſtanding.</hi> While (it may be) many neither care for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit nor underſtanding. So that this fear hath ſome good in it, in as much as it proceeds from a choiceneſſe of ſpirit. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed you do not roſhly, nor groundleſly condemne your ſelfe.</hi> Peradventure, there was more of your ſpirit in prayer, then you ſaw, or ſay, What dare you deny, that at ſuch and ſuch a time your ſpirit was in your prayer? If it were not then what meant thoſe <hi>ſighs, and tears, and groanes!</hi> what meant that <hi>bearing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> and thoſe <hi>liftings up,</hi> and <hi>wringing of the bonds,</hi> if your ſpirit was not in your prayers. Surely? as in point of ſmning, albeit wicked men ſhould ſay their hearts were not in it: Yet their <hi>joy and merriment in it, would witnes againſt them.</hi> So in the manner of praying, though Saints doubt their hearts was not in it, yet their <hi>ſighs,</hi> and <hi>groanes in the ſpirit</hi> (though unutterable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet) they could witneſſe for them in this. However</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:120075:61"/>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Can, and dare you appeale to God, that ſo far as you knew your heart, it was at ſuch and ſuch a time in prayer.</hi> Can you ſay, Lord thou knoweſt that I deſired ſuch a grace, &amp;c. and oh how glad was I in the bare thoughts, and ſmal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hopes that I had of obtaining it: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how did the fear and ſence of not obtaining it grieve me! Surely, if you can thus ſeriouſly, and conſideringly appeal to God, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that your heart and ſpirit was in prayer. Beſides</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Conſider thy ſoule might have been, and may be in a prayer notwithſtanding many dulneſſes and wanderings.</hi> I find by experience, that the ground of this fear, is that dulneſſe, and thoſe wandrings of our ſpirits in prayer. Now cleare it is, that notwithſtanding theſe, yet our ſpirit may be really, (and ſo accounted by God) in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. You know in that duty of <hi>watching with Chriſt in his agony:</hi> Tis recorded the diſciples <hi>ſlept,</hi> yet marke it, Chriſt ſaw, and ſaid their ſpirit was in it. <hi>The ſpirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is willing, but the fleſh is weake.</hi> Chriſt ſaw their <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and acknowledged its <hi>willingneſſe,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>drouſineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for wandrings, you know tis poſſible for the eye to be fixed upon an object, and yet not to be ſo fixt, as to be altogether free from rowlings. The eye may bee upon the ſun, and yet it may twinckle. And certainly, if we ſhould ſay that the heart is not in prayer, becauſe of ſome wandrings, wee ſhould condemn the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the juſt.</hi> For to be ſo intenſe upon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:120075:61"/>God, as to have no wandring thoughts at all, is not attained unto by many, if by any at all. So that now, why ſhouldeſt thou ſay thy ſpirit was not in prayer, becauſe of ſome dulneſſe; and wandrings. Tis poſſible that theſe things may be, and yet God may ſee, yea, and acknowledge thy ſpirit to be in thy prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But alas! (ſaith the ſoule caſt down) <hi>Suppoſe my ſpirit be, or were in prayer, what is that? I feare I never prayed in Chriſts Spirit:</hi> It is one thing to pray in our <hi>ſpirits,</hi> another thing to pray in <hi>Chriſts ſpirit:</hi> Now I feare I never prayed in the ſtrength of Chriſts ſpirit, however it might be in the ſtrength and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my own.</p>
               <p>For anſwer and ſatisfaction to this,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This is a more choyce fear then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> Its a choyce thing to eye our <hi>owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> Its a choicer to eye <hi>Chriſts ſpirit</hi> in prayer. Morall ſincerity may a little put on the former: But its divine ſincerity, which looks after, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> can content themſelves with <hi>ſtrange fire;</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> will not offer but with <hi>holy fire.</hi> Its certainly an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a ſoule more then ordinarily heightned, not to be content to pray in the ſincerity of <hi>our ſpirit,</hi> but to labour for the ſtrength of <hi>Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Tis poſſible to pray in the holy Ghoſt and yet to doubt it.</hi> I find ſome doubting they never prayed in the ſpirit, becauſe they have been ſtraitned, and wanted thoſe inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:120075:62"/>which others have, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now mind it, tis poſſible to pray in, and that by the holy Ghoſt, and yet <hi>not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</hi> The ſoule may be ſo <hi>full,</hi> as that it may not be able to <hi>vent</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Fulneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth ſometimes cauſe ſtraitning.</hi> As now in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> caſe, its ſaid, <hi>then went King David in, and ſat before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. (Then. i. e. when as <hi>Nathan</hi> had been, and told him at large, the rich and ſweet intentions of God towards him) Certainly, now <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit could not chuſe but be very full. And yet mark what he ſaith, <hi>Who am I O Lord God? and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hither-unto? And this was yet a ſmall thing in thy ſight O Lord God: but thou haſt ſpoken alſo of thy ſervants houſe, for a great while to come: and is this the manner of men O Lord God?</hi> But now marke it, what followes (upon this, as it were entry upon the duty) <hi>And what can David ſay more unto thee? for thou O Lord, knoweſt thy ſervant.</hi> See how he is ſtraitened, ſo that hee cannot ſay <hi>more:</hi> But he is fain to ſay (as ſometimes it may be you have done) <hi>Lord thou knoweſt thy ſervant.</hi> So that you ſee, there may be the ſpirit, where, and while the ſoule is ſtraitned, and certainly, as <hi>Hypocrites may have inlargements, and yet not the Holy Ghoſt; ſo Saints may have the Holy Ghoſt, and yet want inlargements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider, <hi>How much of God as a Father didſt thou ſee in prayer.</hi> Its the worke of the ſpirit to helpe the ſoule to ſee God as a father, and to cry <hi>Abba;</hi> and to fill the ſoule
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:120075:62"/>with (not words and expreſſions, but) with ſighs and groanes unutterable.</p>
               <p>So that then to ſatisfie thy ſelf (O dejected ſoule) in this feare, conſider thy very <hi>feare is choyce:</hi> And it <hi>may not be as thou feareſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhall I ſuppoſe it: ſuppoſe it ſhould be ſo, that as yet thou didſt never pray. Suppoſe I admit it, that thou didſt not in the ſincerity of thy ſpirit, nor in the aſſiſtance of Chriſts Spirit pray, yet for all that, conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Free grace can, and doth beſeech ſoules to accept of peace</hi> and <hi>love, who doe not begge for it; God by us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>beſeecheth you.</hi> Though thou didſt not, nor canſt pray to God, yet free Grace comes, and (as I may ſay) <hi>prayes to thee.</hi> Thou ſayeſt, I ſhall never have peace, and reconciliation; for I never by Prayer did beſeech God for it. Why, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God tenders, and in his free grace comes, and beſeecheth you, to accept of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God can give, though ye cannot, or doe not begge;</hi> he is <hi>able</hi> to doe abundantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that we can aske, or thinke, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20 yea and he is <hi>willing, for before they call I will anſwer, ſaith the Lord;</hi> And he is found of them that ſeeke him not. Though God be pleaſed to come in in prayer, yet he is not tyed to it. Beſides;</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>conſider its Chriſts worke to offer up prayers for us;</hi> he lives for ever to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. when thy heart is dead, he lives; and he prayes for thoſe, that doe not, cannot pray for themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:120075:63"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>know the Spirit is promiſed for ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Luk. 11.13. you who cannot pray, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to <hi>aske,</hi> and <hi>to waite for the Spirit:</hi> And you have Chriſts word to encourage, and aſſure you, that you ſhall have the Spirit: ſo that now, why are you caſt downe, as fearing you never did pray? conſider your <hi>feare is good,</hi> yet it may be <hi>groundleſſe.</hi> However Gods heart firſt <hi>opens it ſelfe to us.</hi> Be not caſt downe unto deſpaire, know God can, and will give to ſuch as neither doe, nor can aske; beſides, in time he'l prepare thy heart, and cauſe his eare to heare (as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17.) why may not this raiſe thy ſoule, who art caſt downe, and ſayeſt, thou didſt never pray?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But wilt thou ſay; Suppoſe I have prayed, (indeed I hope I have, and daily I deſire to doe it) but alas! <hi>What though I pray, if God doth not heare; what though I call, he doth not anſwer.</hi> This, O this! doth diſquiet my ſoule: I have prayed oft, but I feare I have been heard never.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed, this is the other branch of the fear, &amp; according to what Chriſt hath given me, I ſhall endeavour to ſcatter it. I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (O ſoule) that <hi>its a miſery ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſable, to pray and not to be heard.</hi> But yet know, many conceive themſelves in this miſery without ground. In order therefore to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and rayſing of thy ſoule under this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, let me prevaile with thee to conſider with ſincere, and ſerious ſpirit, theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:120075:63"/>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God may have heard thee, though thou doe not thinke ſo.</hi> Its true, peradventure God hath not yet returned an anſwer in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; but yet he may have heard your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>God is a free Agent,</hi> and ſo he may take his owne time to ſend an anſwer. Suppoſe thou ſend a Letter to a friend, by a ſure Meſſenger; what though you have not an anſwer preſently, will you ſay, your Letter was loſt, or that your friend did not receive it. Why the caſe is ſo, your prayers are your letters to God, and <hi>Chriſt is a ſure meſſenger;</hi> though as yet God hath not ſent his anſwer, yet your Letters are read, your prayers are accepted: and in time (<hi>viz.</hi> Gods time) they ſhall be punctually anſwered; God will anſwer your prayers, that cry unto him night and day, <hi>though he heare long,</hi> (as it is, <hi>Luk</hi> 18.7.) But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Its poſſible the anſwer may be ſent, and you have not obſerved it.</hi> There are Letters at the Poſt-houſe ſometimes for us, which only want fetching home. The Spirit who brings returnes from Heaven hath an anſwer for us, but we eye him not. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of Gods <hi>going by, and he ſaw him not; of his paſſing on, and he perceived it not,</hi> Job 9.11. O how many times doth God go by us, in <hi>acts of providence,</hi> clearly, and directly anſwering our prayers; and yet we doe not ſee it, nor perceive it? Beſides,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for <hi>any thing you know, your prayers will not be anſwered till you are dead;</hi> your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or the Churches, may have anſwers of your prayers, when you are gone; <hi>or it may
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:120075:64"/>be, God will reſerve the anſwer till your death.</hi> How many dying ſoules have ſaid, now, O now we ſee, and heare, that God hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all our prayers? Why then art thou caſt downe (O ſoule!) about thy prayers, as if they were not anſwered?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But I cannot beleeve that God will ever anſwer.</hi> Sure I am (its well if it be ſo) that I have <hi>eyed Providences exactly,</hi> and could as yet never ſee any anſwer; and what God will doe for time to come, I know not, but I doubt. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>Be it as thou feareſt:</hi> what if God as yet have not anſwered thy prayers in many, in any particulars, yet be not dejected O ſoule over-much, for conſider:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>unanſwered prayers are not loſt,</hi> thou haſt not prayed in <hi>vaine,</hi> for God never bid the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> doe ſo; thy <hi>letters are filed</hi> up in Heaven, and though they are not <hi>anſwered,</hi> yet they are <hi>remembred;</hi> God doth not forget, <hi>your labour of love,</hi> in your letters of love (for ſuch are prayers) its our duty to pray: 'tis Gods grace to anſwer; though as yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales not that grace, yet it makes not voyd our duty.</p>
               <p>Secoundly, <hi>God may be pleaſed with thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, though he doe not anſwer:</hi> The Mother is pleaſed with the Childes liſping, though ſhe ſeeme not to hearken. Thou feareſt (O ſoule) that God <hi>is angry with thy prayers,</hi> (as 'tis, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4.) but why ſhouldeſt thou feare this? God was not angry with his peoples prayer (of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:120075:64"/>which the Pſalmiſt there makes mention) though he did not at that time anſwer it. Your earthly Parents ſometime ſeeme <hi>deafe,</hi> when yet they <hi>delight</hi> to heare their Children <hi>tattle, &amp;c.</hi> may it be thus with the Fathers of your fleſh? why may not, nay why ſhould you not thinke ſo of the <hi>Father of your ſpirits?</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider <hi>what it was you prayed for, and were denyed,</hi> or <hi>not anſwered in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Say (O ſoule) did not God give thee many a <hi>ſpirituall good</hi> thing upon, nay before thy prayers? why art thou caſt downe if he deny thee <hi>temporalls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Nay, but <hi>'tis a ſpirituall good</hi> that I have prayed for, and am not anſwered in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> It <hi>may be</hi> ſo, yet conſider; peradventure, 'tis but a <hi>ſpirituall gift,</hi> as <hi>memory, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, elocution</hi> in prayer; and now, why art troubled (ſoule) ſo much to be denyed in theſe? what are they in themſelves, but ſuch things as reprobates may have? <hi>Gifts may goe to Hell,</hi> yea many <hi>a gifted</hi> perſon is <hi>graceleſſe;</hi> why art caſt downe with the deniall of <hi>gifts,</hi> when Chriſt hath given <hi>graces</hi> without asking?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:120075:65"/>Nay, <hi>but they are graces that I begge, and pray for:</hi> I have gone to begge <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> &amp;c. and yet I have no anſwer to theſe prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Stay <hi>yet (O ſoule) and conſider, it may be thou beggeſt not ſo much the grace, as the degree;</hi> Its not ſo much <hi>faith,</hi> as a <hi>ſtrong faith;</hi> not ſo much <hi>love,</hi> as a <hi>fervent</hi> love, &amp;c. Now conſider (O ſoule) though God deny thee the ſtrength, the <hi>degree of grace,</hi> its choyce mercy thou haſt the <hi>grace it ſelfe.</hi> A little faith, (though but as a graine of Muſtard-ſeed) is precious. Be not caſt downe (O poore heart!) if God deny thee <hi>great</hi> faith, &amp;c. bleſſe him for that he hath given thee <hi>any</hi> faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>

               <p>THe Promiſes are appointed (and indeed were intended) for our comfort, but many ſouls who are dejected, are ſo far from being comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, that they are troubled about them.</p>
               <p>O ſay they, had <hi>we aſſurance that we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Promiſes, we could rejoyce,</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>You have no juſt ground to ſay, you have no right to the Promiſes.</hi> God doth no where ſay, that thou ſhalt have nothing to do with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. <hi>Sith God doth not exclude thee, why ſhouldeſt thou exclude thy ſelfe?</hi> Its not enough to ſay thou art a <hi>ſinner,</hi> for the Promiſes are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto <hi>ſinners.</hi> Its obſervable, there is one Promiſe or other made and tendred unto <hi>all ſorts of ſinners.</hi> But.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, It may be the Promiſe is yours, <hi>and your ſoule hath cloſed with it, although at preſent you doubt.</hi> The Promiſes comming to us, art as ſealed <hi>letters:</hi> and we many times have them in our hand, and read them not.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>thou muſt know</hi> (O ſoule) <hi>that ſome promiſes have their times of fulfilling, and peradventure the time is not yet come;</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>hidden manna</hi> is to a time of conqueſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.17.

               </p>
               <p>Obj. So <hi>I would, if I were but thus, or had but this;</hi> I want the <hi>condition of the promiſe,</hi> and till I have that, I dare not meddle with it.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Beware of this rock</hi> (O ſoule!) <hi>it hath ſplit many, let it not ſplit thee.</hi> To this end you are to know (and pray minde it.)</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>The greateſt promiſes, as of pardon of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>FREE:</hi> Its ſaid <hi>come and take freely,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Promiſes are to give the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> Its conſiderable that whatever condition may be urged as pre-requiſite to any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: is <hi>freely promiſed</hi> in another. <hi>A new heart: a new and right ſpirit: repentance of ſin, victory over corruptions,</hi> &amp;c.

Wherefore then (O dejected ſoul) art thou <hi>caſt down?</hi> as if the Promiſes were not thine, or did not belong to thee. Surely, thou haſt no ground juſtly ſo to ſay. Remember nothing is <hi>freer then the grace of Chriſt, and that is held forth to thee:</hi> And in him all the Promiſes ſhall be <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>amen:</hi> Ariſe (O ſoul) and lay hold on him, and all the Promiſes in him.

               <head type="sub">Satisfaction to Soules caſt downe, and troubled about their abſtinence from ſinne, &amp;c,</head>
               <p>DEjected ſoules are very weake, and hence it is that they are ready to be troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every thing; this Satan ſees, and hence it is that creates trouble in them; even from that, which otherwiſe might comfort them. <hi>Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from ſinne</hi> is expreſly commanded,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.4.</note> and yet even <hi>about obedience to this command, the dejected ſoule is troubled.</hi> Oh ſay ſome, poore hearts (that re caſt downe) we abſtaine from ſinne,<note place="margin">Caſe.</note> 'tis true, but from what principles? Are they not rather <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> and ſlaviſh, then <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and ſincere? <hi>A Dogge chained up is a Dogge ſtill;</hi> and the reaſon why he doth not this, or that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe is his <hi>chaine,</hi> not his <hi>change,</hi> and we feare 'tis ſo with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwer ſoules ſaying thus,<note place="margin">Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and (if it may be) to ſatisfie them under this feare, there be foure things which I deſire may be minded.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Its mercy to be able to abstaine from any principles;</hi> ſinne is ſuch an evill, as that its a great good to be kept from it by any meanes; the heart of ſome is ſo <hi>fully bent</hi> upon ſin, that nothing can reſtraine them; ſome wretches ruſh into abomination <hi>as the Horſe into the battell:</hi> Ah Lord! how many are there who will not, <hi>are not, cannot</hi> be kept from ſinne <hi>by all meanes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:120075:71"/>uſed?</hi> Its a favour (oh poore ſoule) that thou art not as they are; its well for thee thou art not as <hi>wilde</hi> as they: I much feare their caſe who are not afraid of, nor abſtaine from ſinne at all; I little feare thine, who art ſo afraid of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as that thou queſtioneſt not the <hi>reality</hi> of the act, but the <hi>royalty of the principle.</hi> Its a kinde of <hi>high, and royall hatred of ſinne,</hi> when the ſoule cannot be contented only to abſtaine from it; but when its troubled (as thou art O ſoule) that the principles of that abſtinence were not <hi>high,</hi> and <hi>royall</hi> enough.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God traines up his children in holy things by degrees;</hi> as in point of <hi>doing good, and fearing him;</hi> ſo in point of <hi>eſchewing evill,</hi> God carries on by degrees. God takes off his owne people from running into ſinne, ſometimes by <hi>hedging up their way with thornes,</hi> as 'tis, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. Mothers weane their children from the breaſt by <hi>Wormwood</hi> at firſt: God firſt (at leaſt oft) takes us off from ſinne rather by the <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it,</hi> then the <hi>ſweetneſſe of himſelfe.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (O ſoule) as yet thy <hi>abſtinence</hi> from ſinne proceeds <hi>from feare</hi> rather then <hi>love,</hi> yet know its Gods way thus to traine up his children. How many have firſt abſtained from ſinne out of <hi>feare of Hell,</hi> who yet afterward have been helped to abſtaine from it out of <hi>love to Chriſt?</hi> ſome who at firſt could not be kept from ſinne, if they had not been told of <hi>Hell, death,</hi> and <hi>damnation,</hi> have yet in time ſincerely profeſt, they would abſtaine, and avoyd ſinne, if there were <hi>none of thoſe things</hi> at all; ſo it hath been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:120075:71"/>with others, ſo it ſhall be with you. Let thy principles be as <hi>low</hi> as thou feareſt, oh ſoule! <hi>(and yet thy feare argues them higher then thou thinkest)</hi> yet (I ſay) ſuppoſe them <hi>low</hi> now, they may be <hi>high</hi> ere long; <hi>God by degrees will heighten both thy practiſe, and thy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt knowes how to paſſe by low principles, as well as pardon lewd practiſes.</hi> He that can, and doth forgive <hi>acts of ſinne</hi> when <hi>very</hi> high, can and will forgive <hi>abſtinence from ſinne,</hi> when the <hi>principles are low.</hi> Indeed Chriſt <hi>highly</hi> embraces ſoules who are yet <hi>principled but low; Nathaniels</hi> firſt <hi>principle of faith</hi> in Chriſt, was it ſeemes but <hi>low;</hi> Ieſus hints, it was but this, <hi>becauſe he had told him that he ſaw him under the figg-tree,</hi> as 'tis, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.50. Suppoſe thy <hi>abſtinence from ſin</hi> be as low prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled as his <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> yet Chriſt knowes how to <hi>love thee,</hi> as <hi>him:</hi> therefore,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Know you, that happineſſe depends not upon your acts, or principles of abſtaining from ſinne, but upon the bloud of Chriſt, that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſinne.</hi> The Apoſtle knew, that if he ſhould have ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7. &amp; 2.1.</note> himſelfe and other beleevers had <hi>no ſinne,</hi> he ſhould have ſpoke amiſſe; but ſure he was of this, that <hi>the bloud of Chriſt would cleanſe from all;</hi> and that if any ſinned; <hi>they had an Advocate with the Father;</hi> and theſe things he writ that <hi>they might not ſinne:</hi> wherefore then (O ſoule!) who abſtaineſt from ſinne, be not <hi>caſt downe</hi> for feare thy <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of abſtinence</hi> are too low; but rejoyce in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:120075:72"/>this, <hi>that the bloud of Chriſt ſhall take away the guilt of all thy lewd practiſes, and much more the guilt of low, and meane principles,</hi> But yet (O ſoule) know, this gives no <hi>liberty to ſinne;</hi> O no (ſayeſt thou) it doth not, and God forbid that I ſhould ſinne, becauſe of this grace; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for ever to avoyd ſinne, and oh that I could doe it from <hi>holy and high principles.</hi>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> I pray help me herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For thy helpe (O ſoule) in this kinde there are three things, which I offer to thy thoughts, as meanes to <hi>heighten thy prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> in abſtaining from ſinne.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Eye Chriſt as dying for ſinne;</hi> its <hi>low</hi> to abſtaine from ſinne for feare leaſt it ſhould <hi>ſpill our bloud;</hi> but its <hi>high</hi> to adſtaine from ſinne in faith, <hi>that it hath ſhed Chriſts bloud.</hi> Eye thy Saviour on the <hi>Croſſe</hi> (O ſoule!) and that wil ſecretly, and ſpiritually beget theſe thoughts in thee: <hi>Shall I ſinne, for whom Chriſt dyed? Did ſinne kill him, and ſhall not I therefore leave it? Did he lay downe his life for my ſins, and ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Looke upon your ſelves as dead to ſinne, in your Saviours death for ſinne;</hi> if thou art dead <hi>to it,</hi> thou wilt abſtaine <hi>from it;</hi> and if thou abſtaine from ſinne upon this principle, thy principle is high.

               <p>Forthly, <hi>The ſoule guilty of this ſinne cannot be troubled for it, (at leaſt) ſo as to deſire to repent of it, and to have Chriſt to pardon it.</hi> Thy feare, thy trouble, thy diſquiets (O ſoule) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thou art free from this ſinne, for wert thou guilty of it, thy heart it would be hardred, and could not <hi>deſire to repent;</hi> thy Conſcience, it would be ſeared, and no way diſquieted for it; yea and thy deſires would be <hi>dead,</hi> ſo as that thou wouldeſt not pant after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit;</hi> thy very feares, and diſquiets, ſhould anſwer in this caſe themſelves, they could not, would not be in thee, if this ſinne were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

Alas! this (O ſoule) would not, could not be, wert thou guilty of this ſinne. Then,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, anſwer (O ſoule) Doſt thou oppoſe godlineſſe?<label type="milestone">

Yea, thou art ſo farre from oppoſing thoſe that are godly, that thou wouldeſt (if Chriſt would help thee) ſuffer any perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rather then leave off thy endeavour to be godly.</p>
               <p>Now certainly (O poore dejected ſoule) thou art not guilty of the ſinne thou feareſt, for if thou wert, <hi>thou wouldeſt fall away wholly,</hi> and ſpeake evill of the Spirit directly, and oppoſe godlineſſe profeſſedly! ſith theſe things doe ever accompany that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. But,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there have been precious ſoules, who ſometime feared their ſinning againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet have afterward enjoyed the ſealing of the Holy Ghoſt;<note place="margin">See the Bookes of them.</note> Miſtris <hi>Drake,</hi> Miſtris <hi>Wight,</hi> and others of late have brought

Truſt thou in Chriſt, for thou ſhalt yet <hi>praiſe him,</hi> for joy and aſſurance given in by that Holy Ghoſt, againſt whom at preſent thou feareſt that thou haſt ſinned.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:120075:76"/>at firſt, as good as <hi>Adams</hi> in Paradice, yet <hi>Adam</hi> fel, and Angels fel, and we fear the like.</p>
               <p>Now unto theſe ſoules I would offer theſe particulars,<note place="margin">Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> in order, to raiſe them from under this dejection.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Bleſſed is the ſoule that feareth alway;</hi> The ſoule ſtandeth ſureſt while it trembleth, the Apoſtle adviſeth him that ſtandeth, <hi>to take heed leaſt he fall.</hi> And the way to ſtand, is not to be <hi>high minded, but to feare;</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Know your ſtate in regeneration, is ſurer then that of the Angels, and</hi> Adam <hi>in creation.</hi> They were their owne Keepers, but Chriſt is yours; they ſtood upon their owne leggs, but you are held in Chriſts hand.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Your way is not to looke upon your ſelves, but upon your Saviour; he is the Rock that is higher then you, and on him you are ſafe.</p>
               <p>Five grounds there are (amongſt others) upon which you may build your beleefe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The unchangeable love of God;</hi> he loves
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120075:77"/>you with an everlaſting love (therefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, as tis, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3.) He is unchangable in his love (therefore he'l not conſume you, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.) Chriſts love to you is (as himſelfe) <hi>Yeſterday, to day, and for ever the ſame.</hi> Having loved his owne, he loveth them to the end, as it is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The everlaſting decree of God;</hi> this foundation of the Lord abideth ſure, and it hath this ſeale, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Divine decrees alter not, <hi>God will not caſt off bis people whom he fore-knew,</hi> Rom. 11.1. for whom he fore-knew, them he predeſtinated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe according to election ſhall ſtand, <hi>Romans</hi> 9.11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>You have in you an immortall ſeed;</hi> you are borne againe of God, and your ſeed remaines, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. Certainly that which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit; as that which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh; Fleſhly births may dye, but Spirituall births will live.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>You have a ſure promiſe,</hi> Jerem. 32.40. God promiſeth to make an everlaſting Covenant. So likewiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is of a <hi>Well, ſpringing up to everlasting life.</hi> Yea, Gods promiſes in this particular are ſurer then the Mountaines, then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of heaven. Theſe things ſhall paſſe away, but not theſe promiſes; as it is, <hi>Iſay</hi> 54.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.36.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>You have an Almighty power to keep you;</hi> Suck that ſweet place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Bleſſed

There is a power, and that power is the power of a God, and this is put forth in keeping of you.</p>
               <p>So that now, you having ſo many grounds of perſeverance, why ſhould you doubt, and <hi>be dejected?</hi> Your perſeverance doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon your owne power (which is muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) but upon Chriſts promiſe (which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable) He hath promiſed to give you eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and that you ſhall never periſh, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any pull you out of his hand, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as it is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10, 28, 29.) now faithfull is he that hath promiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Oh! <hi>but though none can pull me out of Coriſts hand,</hi> I <hi>may caſt my ſelfe out;</hi> and ſo Chriſt may leave me to Satan, and I fall away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou art deceived (oh dejected ſoule!) if thou thinke, that Chriſt will permit thee to doe that which hee'l not permit Satan; albeit the Childe would fall out of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers armes, yet ſhe'l not let it. Chriſt will uphold thee by the right hand of <hi>his power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 41.10</note> ſo as that albeit thou of thy ſelfe (becauſe of thy fickleneſſe wouldeſt fall) yet he (becauſe of his faithfulneſſe) will not let thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Nay, but yet I read of the falls of many a Saint, <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and others ſtronger by farre then I, have fallen, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:120075:78"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but they were reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; though they fell, yet they did not fall away; Chriſt raiſed them, and he'le alſo raiſe thee: For he hath promiſed to heale back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings; (<hi>i. e.</hi> falls after love and light) and to love (notwithſtanding) them freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Its impoſſible for thoſe who were once inlightened, and have taſted the heavenly gift, &amp;c. if they fall away to renew them by repentance, &amp;c.</hi> Hebrews 6.4.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Minde theſe things to cleare this place (O ſad ſoule!)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle doth not ſay poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſuch as were inlightened, &amp;c. might fall away; he only ſuppoſeth it, <hi>If they doe,</hi> ſaith he, ver. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But if it might not be, why doth the Apoſtle urge it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> As a Caution to make them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. It was impoſſible that <hi>Hered</hi> could kill Chriſt in his Infancy; yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned upon ſuch a feare to fly. <hi>Matthew,</hi> 2.13. And albeit it be impoſſible for ſuch as ere indeed inlightened, and have ſavingly taſted, &amp;c. to fall away; yet ſuch a thing may bee urged to beget <hi>a holy feare,</hi> to make the ſoule diligent, and to keepe it from being ſecure. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Tis common for Hypocrites</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch inlightenings and enjoyments, which are but common and generall) to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but its <hi>impoſſible for Saints, and ſuch
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:120075:78"/>as are ſincere,</hi> and <hi>truly gracious.</hi> Here is nothing ſpoken but what an Hypocrite may have, and that ſuch may fall away is not denyed; but what is this to a ſoule truly beleeving, and ſincerely united to Jeſus Chriſt? Though a Shadow may periſh, what is that to the periſhing of a <hi>ſubſtance?</hi> Doe not diſpute thy ſelfe (O ſoul) into doubts, rather receive ſatisfaction; Chriſt will not <hi>loſe any</hi> that are given to him: Its his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will he ſhould not (as he ſaith <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 6.39.) And ſurely hee'l be faithfull to his Father; Oh therefore, be not thou fearefull of falling, but if thou wilt fear, let it be with <hi>a feare of diligence</hi> to keepe thee from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; let it not be with a feare of <hi>diffidence,</hi> to fill thee with ſorrowes. Chriſt, who <hi>in no wiſe would caſt thee off,</hi> when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt, will in no wiſe loſe thee, now thou art come. If thou <hi>wander,</hi> hee'l <hi>ſeeke thee;</hi> if thou <hi>fall,</hi> hee'l <hi>raiſe thee;</hi> yea and what ever may be thy feares, hee'l uphold thee in his Grace, even to the <hi>Grave;</hi> and beſides; <hi>hee'l raiſe thee up againe at the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I paſſed through thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes which I propoſed to my ſelfe to reſolve. But alas, all that I have ſaid, is but <hi>dead,</hi> unleſſe Chriſt <hi>quicken it.</hi>

               <p>HAving paſt through the particular caſes of dejected ſoules, I thought it not amiſſe to adde by way of ſupplement unto them ſome other; I remember I touched upon eight grounds of Spirituall dejection, and leaſt upon the mention of them any ſoule ſhould be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, I ſhall offer ſomethings to ſatisfie ſuch who is, or may be caſt downe about them; ſo that as in the former Section I indeavoured to ſatisfie the particular feares of dejected ſoules; I ſhall in this, endeavour to cure the generall cauſes of all dejection.</p>
               <p>Divines know there is a difference between a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and a <hi>Caſe,</hi> the one is the <hi>bitter ſeed,</hi> the other the <hi>ſower fruit</hi> of dejection: Now as I have ſaid ſomething to the one, ſo ſhall I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpeake a little to the other.</p>
               <p>To begin then in that order in which I prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them.</p>
               <p>The firſt cauſe of Spirituall dejection was the <hi>remainders of corruption,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> this indeed is the root, and ground of all dejections. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Cure of a ſoule caſt downe, in the ſight and ſence of remaining corruption, I ſhall lay downe theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſider that the worke of Chriſt upon the ſoule doth not in this Life altogether deſtroy</hi>
                  <note place="bottom">Place theſe 2 Sheets [k] [l] next after Fol. 132.</note>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:120075:80"/>
                  <hi>ſinne;</hi> As long as the ſoule is in the body, there will be ſinne in the ſoule; even <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>body of ſinne and death in him,</hi> and till death deſtroy the body, thou muſt not looke to have ſinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together dead in thee. This is granted by all, and why ſhould it be queſtioned by thee, O dejected ſoule!</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider remaining corruption will worke one time or other;</hi> A Dogge though in a chaine will barke, and ſometimes bite too; a man cannot carry fire in his boſome, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other it wil heat him, if it doe not burne him. Thou cryeſt out (O dejected ſoul) that they remaining corruption doth oft di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe thee; but why ſhouldeſt, or how canſt thou expect the contrary? While thou dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt in this houſe of Clay, that Dunghill wil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy thee. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Remember corruptions groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as a burden, are rather a ground of rejoycing then of dejection;</hi> for, Firſt, <hi>it argues a life of bolineſſe, to feele a weight in ſinne;</hi> Dead men feele no weight be it never ſo heavie: and, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>it argues an activity of life to groane;</hi> Many ſoules rather glory in, then groane under a weight of ſinne, but it is a ſpeciall mercy thou art not as they are.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Beleeve it (O ſoule) Jeſus Christ doth ſimpathize with thee under this thy burthen:</hi> While thou groaneſt under, and art caſt down at the ſight of remaining corruption, thou art the object of Chriſts compaſſion. <hi>It is a good plaiſter for any ſore, to conſider the pitty of our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:120075:80"/>Saviour:</hi> Chriſt pitties thee (O poore dejected ſoule) to ſee thee labouring, and groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the remainder of ſinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Conſider remaining corruption ſhall never ruine thee:</hi> As the remaining <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> did not, could not ruine <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land; ſo neither ſhall remaining cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ever ruine thy ſoule. Could corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ruine thy holineſſe, joy, ſalvation glory &amp;c. thou mighteſt be much dejected indeed; but that it cannot, ſhall not doe. Thy holineſſe, thy joy, thy ſalvation, thy glory, &amp;c. are all ſafe in the impregnable bulwark Chriſts hand, (which is the infinite power of God) and though corruption remaine in thee, it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ruine theſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Conſider Jeſus Chriſt dyed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thee from the remainders of corruption:</hi> And doe thou act thy faith on thy Saviours death, for thy ſinnes death; the vertue of his death remaines, to keep under corruption from having dominion. It is thy duty, and let it be thy care and endeavour, to goe to Jeſus Chriſt for ſtrength againſt, and victory over thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining corruption; therefore up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, beleeving. Doe not ſit ſolitary (as one caſt downe) to ſee ſome remainders of ſin. Suppoſe (O ſoule) you had ſeene ſome gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Captaine reſcuing a perſon, or place from the power of ſome potent enemy, by breaking the ſtrength and power of the Enemy, and by taking up his abode in ſome Caſtle neare the place. Suppoſe after this, there ſhould appeare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:120075:81"/>ſome ſcattered Parties, ſhould the perſon or place be dejected at the remainder of a routed adverſary, ſhould not they rather goe to their Conquerour and Captaine, and intreat him to ſuppreſſe thoſe remaining forces? Beare up (O caſt-downe ſoule) the caſe is thine, Chriſt the Captaine of thy ſalvation hath routed the <hi>maine body of ſinne upon his croſſe,</hi> and ſpoiled corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his chiefeſt ſtrength; he hath ſet up a garriſon in thy ſoule, and put in a party ſtrong enough to repell, and keep under the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forces; O goe to him, ſtirre up his Spirit to come forth, and to bring thy <hi>Conquerours ſword</hi> to check and ſuppreſſe thy tumultuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; I meane, to <hi>lift up thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours croſſe againſt thy corruptions.</hi> And beleeve it (ſoule) there is a vertue ſtill in that <hi>Croſſe,</hi> to keep the remainders of corruption under. Be not therefore caſt downe, but beleeve; and if thou <hi>by the Spirit</hi> (whom Chriſt hath put into the garriſon of thy ſoule) <hi>doe goe forth, and mortifie ſinne, thou ſhalt live, and it ſhall dye at laſt.</hi>

               <p>THe ſecond cauſe of Spirituall dejection was (as I mentioned) <hi>falls into ſinne:</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:120075:81"/>This caſts down the ſoule, that the remainders of corruption doe not only worke, but that ſometimes they prevaile; ſometimes the ſoule is actually overtaken with ſinne, and falls it may be, into ſome foule fact; now this cauſeth caſting downe: to cure which,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> I ſhall ſpeake ſomething in particular, when I have premiſed this one thing in generall, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It muſt be confeſſed it is ſad to fall into ſinne;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sadneſſe.</note> After the ſoule hath been in Chriſts armes, to fall into the pits of Satan (for ſo ſins are) muſt needs goe to its heart; indeed it goes to Chriſts: He is offended really, and mightily, that any ſoules who have taſted his grace, in <hi>pardoning paſt ſins,</hi> and knowen that ſuch a pardon coſt his bloud; I ſay, he is offended, that ſuch ſhould afterward commit, or fall into any ſinne, but yet, all things weighed, there may be much, yea and enough ſaid to cure and comfort a <hi>ſoule dejected, becauſe of falls into ſin after grace.</hi> As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such a thing</hi> (as this) <hi>is conſiſtent with grace.</hi> This is that which cauſeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ſuch ſoules as fall into ſinne,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> that they are thereby drawne to doubt the <hi>truth of their grace;</hi> for ſay they, ſurely had we been ever really and ſtrongly wrought upon, wee could never have failen into ſuch and ſuch ſins.</p>
               <p>But yet, theſe ſoules ſhould doe well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Sampſon</hi> fell againe, and againe into the ſame ſinne of <hi>wantouneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Judg. 14.3. &amp; 15.20. &amp; 16.1.</note> and yet he is in the Catalogue of the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and reckoned up amongſt the worthy belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:120075:82"/>(<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) Its the opinion of many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wiſe perſons, that <hi>David</hi> fell more then once into the ſinne of lying; and that therefore he prayed to be kept from the way of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.29. I mention not this to countenance (much leſſe to incourage) preſumptuous deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſinners, but only to cure perplexed and dejected Saints; ye are deceived (O ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſoules!) if you thinke your falls into ſinne be inconſiſtent with grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider, falls into ſinne are not falls from ſalvation;</hi> The Covenant of Grace is not made null by thy fall (O caſt-downe ſoule!) though <hi>Iſrael</hi> have <hi>played the Harlot,</hi> yet Chriſt remaines a <hi>Husband.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 3.1.1.14.</note> God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, though thy children ſinne, and though I viſite their ſinnes with a rod, <hi>yet my Covenant will I not breake,</hi> Pſal. 89. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture (O ſoule) thou art caſt downe, as thinking thy fall into ſinne hath cut off the band of the Covenant, but thou art miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Yea,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is a ſpeciall ſalve prepared for this ſore,</hi> a particular cure for this cauſe of dejection, viz. <hi>Promiſes of pardon after falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne; ILE HEALE BACK-SLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINGS,</hi> Hoſ. 14.3. Surely that ſuppoſeth falls into ſinne after grace (for what elſe is back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding?) and that directly propoſeth pardon, and healing to ſuch ſoules. <hi>Returne yee back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding children, and I will heale your back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings,</hi> Jer. 3.22. Marke (O dejected ſoule) Chriſt calleth thee to <hi>returne,</hi> and he ſpeakes to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120075:82"/>thee as to a Childe ſtill (notwithſtanding thy falls into ſinne) therefore be thou adviſed to ariſe, and to goe to him, urge him with his promiſe, and hee'l make it good: Neither is this my advice, but the advice of the Lord. Heare him in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. <hi>O Iſrael, returne unto the Lord thy God</hi> (marke it, <hi>thy God</hi> ſtill) for thou haſt fallen (ſee ſoule how he points at thy ſtate) <hi>by thine iniquity.

               <p>I Said, that <hi>ignorance of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> was likewiſe a cauſe (and a chiefe cauſe) of Spirituall dejection; and therefore I hinted in the uſe of the firſt Section advice to ſtudy it; I ſhall briefly offer ſomething to this here, for many times dejected ſoules cry out, <hi>They are, and may be well caſt downe, for alas they are not in that Covenant.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> Were I in the Covenant of Grace (cryes the dejected ſoule) I could rejoyce, but alas, I doubt it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:120075:83"/>I am dejected. Alas, <hi>I finde many things in that Covenant promiſed, which indeed I could wiſh; but alas!

               <p>Firſt, <hi>The things of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ovenant are not wrought all together;</hi> there are many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars promiſed, as <hi>feare, new ſpirit, tender heart,</hi> &amp;c. each of which is wrought in its time and order. It is true, the generall root of all theſe is given to the ſoule, viz. <hi>The Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but yet the particular branches ſpring up in their ſeaſon. Thou wouldeſt ſee all (O ſoul) but thou muſt ſtay the time, and thou ſhalt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Neither is any one particular perfectly wrought at once;</hi> a ſoft heart is a thing wrought by degrees, and <hi>to have the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our hearts</hi> is buſineſſe of time; it is a long Copy, which Chriſts Spirit is writing a long time: <hi>As we are alway learning, ſo that is alway writing.</hi> Thou (O poore ſoule) woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt have all together, and at once, and in truth who would not be glad (if it might be) to have it ſo; but we muſt wait, for this worke is not the buſineſſe of a day, but of our whole life.</p>

But,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Suppoſe it as thou feareſt, <hi>take hold of the Covenant now.</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>It is a free Covenant,</hi> reached out to poore ſinners upon tearmes of grace, Free Grace, rich grace, and not upon workes, or qualifications: It promiſeth all things, but it requires nothing but acceptance.</item>
                  <item>2 <hi>It is a full Covenant;</hi> it extends to all ſinnes, originall, actuall, great, little; to ſins of ignorance and infirmity; to ſins of preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obſtinacy.</item>

               <p>I ſay therefore, Ariſe (O caſt-down ſoule) God in the Covenant of Grace calls to rebels, and ſaith, Let them take hold of my ſtrength, that they may make peace with me, &amp; they ſhal, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27.5.

               <p>Now to cure this, I ſhall apply theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Plaiſters.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Life and indiſpoſition may conſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> Every living man is not lively alway: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Spouſe of Chriſt was ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:120075:84"/>Saint diſpoſed to duties at all times alike;</hi> and why ſhouldeſt thou be caſt downe at the common Lot, and condition of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is a mercy thou art not quite dead to duty.</hi> Many a ſoule is ſtarke dead to prayer, ſtarke dead to the Word, &amp;c. and it is Free Grace, thou art at worſt but <hi>indiſpoſed,</hi> better is the crawling Snaile then the dead Elephant; And it is a more bleſſed ſtate to be a <hi>creeping worme (though with much indiſpoſition) in the way of duty and life; then a skipping heart (though with much agility) in the way of ſinne and death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Though thy indiſpoſedneſſe be ſad, yet thy trouble for this is ſweet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> Bleſſed is the ſoule that mournes for diſpoſition to evill, and indiſpoſition to good.

But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Conſider thy acceptance with God doth not depend upon thy doing of duty, nor upon thy livelineſſe and diſpoſition in doing;</hi> no, it depends ſolely upon his grace. <hi>You are accepted in the beloved,</hi> as it is in that precious place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. Both thy <hi>perſon</hi> (notwithſtanding its faults) and thy <hi>performances</hi> (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their failings) are alwayes accepted in Chriſt, <hi>he hath made us accepted in the beloved;</hi> marke it, it is not thou, but God that makes thee (I ſay, MAKES thee) not thy ſelfe that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:120075:85"/>makeſt thy ſelfe accepted; yea, and this is in <hi>the Beloved</hi> (not in our duties, or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) but in the BELOVED, i. e. in Chriſt Jeſus. I tell thee, poore ſoule, couldeſt thou doe well, and with never ſo much life and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition out of Chriſt, it were nothing. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though thy doings be poore, thy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition poore, all poore, yet thou and all thine are accepted IN THE BELOVED.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is the office of Chriſt to preſent all thy performances to God, and to procure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in his bloud.</hi> He takes away all thy failings, and indiſpoſitions, and he preſents all to the Father well.<note place="margin">Minde this.</note> 
                  <hi>Duties goe never from Saints to God as they come out of their owne hands, but as they goe through Chriſts.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>God gave thee much at firſt to incourage thee, as a beginner;</hi> which he doth not alway to all. Vſually, it is in Gods Houſe as it is in ours, at firſt comming of a Servant, the Maſter is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more familiar then afterward. At firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming God might give much to welcome thee, and to ingage thee, but now thou haſt been long in his houſe, he mindes thee as much as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, though he hint it not ſo often. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God may with-hold incomes to try thee, whether thou ſerveſt him for LOVE, or for the LOAVES:</hi> Many ſerve Chriſt not <hi>for himſelfe,</hi> but for <hi>themſelves;</hi> rather for the <hi>penny of income,</hi> then for <hi>reſpect to him.</hi> Now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:120075:86"/>Chriſt may with-hold incomes to try thee, and therefore be not <hi>caſt downe for want of them,</hi> leſt thou give him ground to ſuſpect thee; but conſider,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is Chriſts Prerogative</hi> (if he will uſe it) <hi>to make us ſerve for nothing.</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſpeakes it to the <hi>Kings Daughter,</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>He is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him,</hi> Pſal. 45.11. He muſt be worſhipped as a <hi>Lord,</hi> becauſe of his greatneſſe, though hee ſhould not give any income, or wages. Yet,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He doth waite to give income in its ſeaſon.</hi> There are times when incomes will be moſt ſweet, and Chriſt doth waite for thoſe times: Chriſt ſaid to his Mother, <hi>Woman, what have I to doe with thee,</hi> Joh. 2. He knew there would by and by be a fitter ſeaſon to doe that which ſhe deſired, then at that time; your time (ſaid Chriſt) is alwayes, <hi>my time is not yet come,</hi> as it is, <hi>Job.</hi> 7, 6. O remember (deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſoule) <hi>Chriſt waites to be gracious;</hi> his income ſhall be when fitteſt for thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It will argue a choyce frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thee</hi> (and therefore I mention it, to preſſe it on thee) <hi>to doe duty, notwithſtanding thou want income.</hi> To worke without wages, argues a love to the Maſter we work for; a mercinary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit wil doe for pay, but a gracious childe-like ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will pay its ſelfe in its doing, and continue praying, hearing, receiving, &amp;c. even without any income. But,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To cure thy dejected ſoule, who art troubled for want of income; <hi>Know, that in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:120075:86"/>Heaven thou ſhalt have income for all.</hi> The Maſter called the Servants at <hi>the evening,</hi> and <hi>gave then, to each his penny.</hi> O conſider thou ſhalt ere long have income to the full, when thou ſhalt enter <hi>into thy Maſters joy;</hi> when thou ſhalt reſt from thy labours, thy income ſhall follow thee; when thou ſhalt come to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome (<hi>and there thou ſhalt come, dejected ſoule, as poore a</hi> Lazarus, <hi>as thou art</hi>) then thou ſhalt have every prayer, every ſigh, every groane come to remembrance, and ſay, now thou haſt all that which we went out for.</p>
               <p>Rouſe up therefore, O caſt-downe ſoule, God is a good Maſter, you ſhall not labour in vaine: <hi>Be not</hi> dejected, but be <hi>ſtedfaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, alway abounding in the worke of the Lord, for as much as you know your labour is not in vaine in the Lord,</hi> as tis, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. laſt. why then ſhould you be caſt downe for <hi>lacke of income.</hi>

               <p>I Remember another cauſe I mentioned of dejections, was the <hi>inſultation of Satan</hi> and enemies; many ſoules are dejected at this, that Satan (and his inſtruments
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120075:87"/>triumph over, as it is at large ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Now to cure and comfort thoſe,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate dejected ſoules to minde, and remember theſe inſuing things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Satan will inſult without ground:</hi> Hee'l ſay to <hi>David, Where is his God,</hi> and hee'l but <hi>if</hi> to Chriſt, concerning his being <hi>the ſonne of God.</hi> Sathan is an impudent enemy, who will bragge, and triumph againſt a ſoule for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is the nature of a Dogge to barke, a Lion to roare,<note place="margin">Woolfe.</note> a Wolfe to howle; and it is the nature of Sathan to inſult: Be not therefore caſt downe at it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Though Sathan inſults, Chriſt is a friend, and loves us ſtill;</hi> even at that time that Sathan inſulted, and buffeted <hi>Paul,</hi> Chriſts grace was ſufficient. Should the Childe be caſt down for the inſulting of the <hi>Groome,</hi> or the <hi>Scullion,</hi> when he is beloved of his Father, as his Heire? What, though Satan ſay, <hi>Where is thy God, thy hope, &amp;c.</hi> mayeſt not thou (O ſoule) ſay, My God, and hope is in Heaven ſtill. All the Devils in Hell, and men on earth, ſhall never, can never ſeperate between thee and thy God; <hi>neither Principalities, nor Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor Life, nor Death, nor any thing can ſeparate, &amp;c.</hi> Triumph (O ſoule) in that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.37. though Sathan inſult, be not thou caſt downe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The time ſhall come, when thou ſhalt tread upon thy inſulting enemy, and when he ſhall be aſhamed for all his inſultations.</hi> Remember
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:120075:87"/>(O caſt downe ſoule! (<hi>the God of peace will</hi> (though thou canſt not) and <hi>that ſhortly, tread downe Sathan under your</hi> (even thy) <hi>feet,</hi> Rom. 16.20. Chriſt will take thee by the hand, and owne thee in the preſence of God, Angels and men, yea and Devills too; And then thy enemy (Sathan) ſhall ſee, who ſaid where is thy God, even then he ſhall ſee thy God as thine, and be confounded for all his inſultation over thee.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, (for wicked men,) who now it may be deride and ſcoffe at thee, be not dejected for them. <hi>Becauſe the day will come when they will wiſh they were as thou art.</hi> When they ſhall as much admire at thy happineſſe, and wiſdome, as now they ſleight thy ſtate, and thoughts; when God ſhall bring thee forth to light, and thou ſhalt behold his righteouſneſſe. Then ſhall all thy enemies ſee it, and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which ſaid where is the Lord thy God; Then ſhall they licke the duſt like a Serpent, and ſhall fear, not only becauſe of <hi>the Lord our God,</hi> but alſo becauſe <hi>of thee,</hi> as it is in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Scripture. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9.10.17. which ſcripture if thou read ſeriouſly and act faith upon.

               <p>SPirituall dejection is ſometimes cauſed by corporall affliction: A ſick body doth in ſome perſons make a ſad ſoul.<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſick, and had received the ſentence and meſſage of death, <hi>he turned to the wall and wept;</hi> And the thoughts of the dying of his body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced dejection in his ſoul.

Only take a few ingredients, which mixed together, and applyed, may ſerve in this caſe to raiſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Spirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider the great ground of this dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a deceit.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Your father knows your frame:</hi> He knowes what you can beare, and hee'le lay no more upon you, then your ſtrength can maſter; <hi>The Lord will not alwayes chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever</hi> ('tis ſpoken of affliction, by diſeaſes as ſeemes to be hinted verſ. 3.) <hi>But as a father pittyeth His children, ſo the Lord pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth them who feare him: for hee knoweth our frame, he remembreth wee are but duſt.

               <p>Mind this (O thou ſick and ſad ſoule!) thy father knowes thy frame, he minds thou art but duſt, and he pittyes thee in all thy affliction, which he layes upon thee: Yea, he ſits by, and <hi>makes all thy bed in thy ſicknes,</hi> as tis Pſa. 41. <hi>And he maketh ſore, and bindeth up; be woundeth; and his hand maketh whole,</hi> as it is in Job 4 18. that is ſpoken of ſickneſſe too.

Hath he not ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make thee ſay (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid) <hi>I ſhall not dye, but live, to declare the workes of God,

O bear up dejected heart, though thou be ſick, yet thou mayſt recover; and goe up to the houſe of God, where thou mayeſt praiſe him for health reſtored to thee; and ſay, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoule, and all that is within me bleſſe his holy name, who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No wilt thou ſay, <hi>I would beare ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but that I feare death.</hi> This thought, I ſhall dye, is that which caſts me down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> 'Tis true, I thinke (and I know) here is the bottome of the doubt, and dejection, to ſpeake therefore to it directly.</p>
               <p>Ile grant it, thou ſhalt dye (though it may be not now) but ſuppoſe I ſay now,<note place="margin">Caſe.</note> even now, thou ſhalt die, yet conſider theſe things, and thou needeſt not be dejected.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt came to deliver thee from this feare.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cure.</note> Its the feare of death, that doth more deject, then death it ſelf. Now remember, Chriſt came to free thee from this feare: <hi>For as much as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of the ſame; that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devill, And</hi> (marke it) <hi>deliver them, who through the feare of death, were all their life time ſubject unto bondage,</hi> Heb. 2.14, 15. Conſider, Chriſt hath deſtroyed him that had the power of death, the Devill,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:120075:89"/>and hath delivered thee, Couldeſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this (and why ſhouldeſt thou not?) thou mighteſt triumph. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt hath tooke away the ſting of death.</hi> Death is a Bee (having the hony of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from this vile body, &amp;c.) but it hath no ſting. For what ſaith the Scripture: <hi>The ſting of death is ſin, the ſtrength of ſin is the law, but thankes bee to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> goe thou to that glorious chapter 1 Corinth. 15. and read it. O thou! that art dejected with feares of death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt will be with thee in that hour thou feareſt.</hi> Thou ſhalt not dye alone, for though all thy friends ſhall leave thee, yet wil not Chriſt. This <hi>David</hi> knew, for ſpeaking of his <hi>ſhepherd</hi> (and who is the ſhepheard but our Lord Jeſus, as tis <hi>Hel:</hi> 13.20.) He ſaith, <hi>although I walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evill</hi> (he needed not) for obſerve what he ſaith, THOU ART WITH MEE, <hi>thy rod and thy ſtaffe they comfort me,</hi> Pſal. 23.4 Albeit thy relations bid thee farewell, and ſhake hands, as not being willing, nor able to keep thee longer company, yet Chriſt wil not leave thee, nor forſake thee. In truth, in life, nor death, hee'le never doe that, as tis <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Death ſhall be no death to thee.</hi> A change it wil be, and that from worſe to the better, but its not a death. Did not Chriſt ſay it? <hi>Whoſoever liveth and beleeveth in me,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120075:90"/>ſhall never dye, yea though he were dead, yet ſhal he live,</hi> John 11.26. Thou muſt not call that death, which the Scripture cals but ſleep. The Scripture ſpeakes of the dead in Chriſt, that they ſleep in Jeſus, 1 Theſſ: 4.14. And <hi>ſhe is not dead but ſleepeth; and our friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleepeth.</hi> Now why ſhouldeſt thou (O ſoule) who art weary, be caſt down with the thoughts of ſleep.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Chriſt hath ſweetned death for thee.</hi> He hath layne in the grave, and ſo honoured, and ſoftned that bed unto beleevers. Would any child be afraid to lye in its mothers bed? Is it not an Honour, to lye down in the ſame bed in which the King of glory lay? Art dejected (O ſoule) to go into thy Saviours Sepulchre? what art thou caſt downe with the feares of gain? to dye is gaine, ſaid <hi>Paul:</hi> Philip. 1.21.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>Chriſt will raiſe you up againe:</hi> Hee hath ſaid ſo, and if he ſhould not, he would not only breake his own word, but diſobey his fathers will; neither of which hee'l doe. <hi>This is the fathers will, who hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould looſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> This Chriſt ſpake once, yea twice (and pray marke it wel) <hi>John</hi> 6 39, 41. Chriſt (O ſoul) wil raiſe thee up againe. Should the child be afraid to goe to ſleep at night, when his Father promiſeth to raiſe him up in the morning? Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to raiſe up your bodies again: yea, and he hath promiſed to give you a new ſpirit into
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:120075:90"/>the bargaine, for tis ſowne a Naturall, but rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Spirituall body.</p>
               <p>Put all this together (O thou dejected ſoul) and tell me now, What cauſe haſt thou to be caſt downe with the thoughts of death? May not theſe conſiderations cure that cauſe of thy dejection? Thou art now troubled with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, weakneſſe, paines, &amp;c. but let death come (doe not feare it) and thou ſhalt be cured of all Diſeaſes, yea and which is better, freed from all defilements. Methinkes therefore you ſhould rather deſire to be deſolved, then feare death, and imitate thoſe who groaned to be <hi>uncloathed of this earthly houſe,</hi> as knowing they have a better, <hi>even a building with God, an houſe not made with hands, eternall in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. Goe (O caſt down ſoule!) to that Scripture, and thou wilt in it finde a Cordiall to cheere, and cure thy ſpirit in this feare.</p>

               <p>A Little wrath of the Almighty caſts the ſoule very low,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> even as low as Hell <hi>(for what elſe is Hell but Divine wrath felt?)</hi> How many dejected hearts are there that cry out, that the Almighty is angry, that he frownes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:120075:91"/>them, and that every wrinckle in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is a grave burying all their comforts. When men ſmite, God can cure; and <hi>when God giveth quietneſſe, who then can make trouble; but when be hideth his face, who then can behold him?</hi> Job 34.29.</p>
               <p>Indeed, this is a ſad cauſe of dejection, and it puts the ſoule into a very dejected caſe indeed, yet it is not incurable; a ſoule that is caſt down by the ſence of Gods wrath, may be raiſed, if Chriſt will helpe it to minde, and beleeve theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This caſe is not ſingular;</hi> even many holy men, and women in all Ages of the world have been in this condition:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> 
                  <hi>Company is a comfort even in miſery.</hi> Thou needeſt not cry out, O ſoule and ſay, <hi>Was there ever ſorrow like unto mine?</hi> Yes, there was, thou feeleſt thine owne paine; but <hi>David, Job, Heman, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. felt as much (peradventure more) wrath then thou doſt; but why doe I ſpeake of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars? When as I remember the Lord had not <hi>mercy,</hi> but INDIGNATION upon <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (i. e. the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) threeſcore and ten yeares, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.12. yea as the <hi>body,</hi> ſo the <hi>head</hi> of all the godly was made ſenſible of Gods wrath, for Chriſt drunk <hi>the cup of his Fathers wrath;</hi> it is more then a bad and unſound way of arguing, <hi>I am under Gods wrath, and therefore I am not Gods Childe?</hi> This way of arguing condemnes all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods wrath is rather in appearance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120075:91"/>then in truth;</hi> It is a Vizzard, not thy Fathers face that lookes ſo terrible; thy Fathers face is <hi>love, all love, only love (fury is not in him)</hi> only now he hath put on a <hi>Vizzard</hi> to ſcare thee a little, and hee'l lay it aſide againe; he doth but <hi>hide his face</hi> under that Maske, hee'l open it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, Iſa.</hi> 54.2. Marke it, wrath is but a vaile that hides Gods face in, it is not his reall face, it is but as we ſay, <hi>A copy of his countenance.</hi> There is never a <hi>black letter</hi> in all Gods face (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as to his children) no, <hi>God is love,</hi> it is his Name, in love there is no unlovely letter. Thou ſayeſt, <hi>God is angry;</hi> it is true he appeares ſo,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> but he is not ſo: As <hi>he is never truly pleaſed with ſinners</hi> (but is angry againſt them every day) <hi>notwithſtanding their conceit; ſo he is never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed diſpleaſed with Saints whatever they feele, or feare. But,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>All the anger and wrath of God is not againſt thy perſon, but againſt thy ſinne.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy Childe be ſick, and wounded deeply, wounded with ſome bloody gaſh, or cut, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately ſicke of ſome ugly Diſeaſe; thou art diſpleaſed, but with what? with his Perſon? with thy childe? No, but with his wound, with his diſeaſe: So it is with God, he is only angry and diſpleaſed with thy ſinne, thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his rough hand which thou feeleſt, is but to take away, and purge out that; he is wel pleaſed with thee. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is a deare ſtill, though God ſpeake againſt him, <hi>his bowels are troubled for him,</hi> as it is, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.18. Againe,</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:120075:92"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is a mercy to be ſenſible, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for Divine diſpleaſure.</hi> There is many a hard-hearted wretch in the world, that ſlights God, that makes a mock of ſin, and wrath too. Bleſſed be God that thou (as <hi>David</hi>) canſt ſay, <hi>My fleſh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements,</hi> Pſal. 119.120. And,</p>

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>um.</note> 
                  <hi>Job</hi> 10.20.</p>
               <p>Sure <hi>Job</hi> did give way to his ſorrow, when he ſet himſelfe, as it were, to weep. And the Pſalmiſt holds forth as much, when hee ſaith, <hi>my ſoul refuſeth to be comforted,</hi> Pſa. 77.3. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that refuſeth comfort, gives way to ſorrow.</p>
               <p>You dejected ſoules! ſpeake the truth, is it not thus. Do not you give way to ſadneſſe (at leaſt) ſometimes? How oft do you diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelves? How oft do you maintaine your ſorrowes? How oft doe you argue againſt your comforts, and flye from your comforters? Surely, you do often give way to ſadneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſons, whence it comes to paſſe, that dejected ſoules are proane to give way to ſadneſſe, and dejection may be theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A ſtrong conceit that they have reaſon ſo to do.</hi> Oh-ſay many, we may well weep, and mourn; we may wel be dejected and caſtdown, we have reaſon for it, ſo they conceit. And albeit when the reaſon is told, it appears light, yet they are apt to conceit it weighty. Its with dejected ſouls, as it was with <hi>Micah, when his carved Image, his Ephod, his Teraphim, his graven Image, and his Prieſt were</hi> taken away. Hereupon, he gathers together his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:120075:97"/>ſervants and neighbours to purſue them that had ſtole them: And being asked the reaſon, he ſaith, <hi>ye have taken away my gods, &amp;c. and doe you aske me what aileth me?</hi> He conceited hee had great reaſon to be troubled. Even ſo many poore ſoules, who have loſt, it may be, but their Idolls; Relations, Parts, Inlargements, &amp;c. (which they idolized) they are <hi>caſt downe,</hi> and they give way to it, as conceiting they had ground ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Dejected ſoules are prone to give way to dejections, <hi>From a ſtrange kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſſe, which doth often times ſeize them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their ſadneſſe.</hi> Even good <hi>Jonah</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken with this evill. God ſees him caſt down, and comes to him and ſaith, <hi>Doeſt thou well to be angry?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>I do well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, even to the death:</hi> Jonah 4.9. Ah Lord! what a perverſe ſpeech is here. How ſweetly doth God reaſon with him. God might have reprooved him, have chid him, but hee doth not; he only askes him if it <hi>were well done,</hi> as a loving father askes the ſad child; child, doſt well to be ſad? And yet obſerve, <hi>Jonah's</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe, <hi>I do well,</hi> ſaith he, yea, I do well, <hi>to be troubled unto death.</hi> What a ſullen ſpeechis this! Dejected ſoules, is it not ſo with you ſometimes? Are not you perverſe. Doth not your ſoul ſay, its well to be ſad? This is another reaſon of your giving way thereunto.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>An over-high eſteem of ſome things which the dejected ſoule hath loſt, makes it give way to ſadneſſe.</hi> Soules doe over-value many
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:120075:97"/>things, this makes them over ſad many times. <hi>Rachell</hi> did prize her children too high, and that made her give way to ſorrow ſo farre, as that ſhe <hi>would not be comforted, becauſe her children were not.</hi> Tis poſſible to prize even ſpiritual things too high; as Parts, Performances, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, &amp;c. And if we prize them too high, we will ſoon give way to ſorrow (for want of them) too farre.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>An opinion</hi> (though groundleſſe) <hi>that it muſt be ſo, makes many give way to ſorrow and dejection.</hi> Some conceit, becauſe tis ſaid, that <hi>bleſſed are they that mourn; and woe to them that laugh, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore the ſoule muſt be ſad, and heavy, and dejected. Theſe Scriptures are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and the miſtake of them, is the reaſon why many give way to dejection. Its true, Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the <hi>mourners</hi> bleſſed, but it was rather to ſtop their <hi>mourning</hi> then to increaſe it: It was rather to give them joy, then to give them ground to ſorrow. Its true alſo, Chriſt did denounce woe to them that were <hi>merry</hi> and did <hi>laugh:</hi> But it was ſuch, whoſe <hi>mirth</hi> was carnall, and ſo <hi>madneſſe.</hi> Not to ſuch as rejoyce in the Lord, (for that we are commanded to doe alwayes.) But yet from the miſ-underſtanding of theſe and the like Scriptures, dejected ſoules conceit a receſſity of ſadneſſe, that it muſt be, and therefore they give way unto it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Some conceive that the truth of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, lyes in its depth,</hi> and therefore they give way to dejection, as conceiving that to be deep, and true humiliation. It was obſerved by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:120075:98"/>Divine,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sibs.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>men are deceived, when they thinke a dejected ſpirit, an humbled ſpirit.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poor heart thinks, its weeping, its ſorrow, its going heavy, &amp;c. to be true, and deep humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and I wiſh ſome Preachers had not gon too far this way) now upon this account, its no wonder, if they give way to it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Its the innate nature of melancholly to give way thereunto.</hi> There is certainly a religious melancholly, and ſome delight in it. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a kind of Divinity in dejection, Sorrow hath a kind of ſweetneſſe in it. And a ſoul caſt downe, is prone to feed upon its dejection. There is an innate propenſity in all ſadneſſe and melancholly (as indeed there is in all the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to feed, and nouriſh it ſelfe. And hence it is, that ſouls caſt down are prone to give way thereunto.</p>

               <p>HAving premiſed that we are prone to give way to ſadneſſe, and dejection: I ſhall now prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>Its true, <hi>de facto</hi> (O dejected ſoules) that you art prone to give way to your dejections: But its not true <hi>de jure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know by experience you are lyable to it, but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:120075:98"/>I know that it ſhould not be. It is your wiſdom, and it ſhould be your care, not to give way to your dejections, and caſtings down.</p>
               <p>The Text witneſſeth it ſelfe clearely to this truth. This queſtion hath in it the force of a negation: <hi>why art thou cast downe,</hi> virtually, is as much as thou <hi>ſhouldeſt not be caſt down?</hi> As <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Why gaddeſt thou about? &amp;c.</hi> Its as much as there is no cauſe for it, and it ſhould not bee. So here, <hi>Why art thou caſt down?</hi> is as much as there is no cauſe, or reaſon for this <hi>caſting down</hi> of my ſelfe, and giving way unto it, for it ſhould not be.</p>
               <p>When our Lord perceived the dejection of his Diſciples (upon the thought of his departure) he bids them not give way unto it. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi> John. 14.1.

               </p>
               <p>I need not ſtand to prove it further. This one Demonſtration wil clear it; <hi>We ſhould not give way to that which we have no reaſon for:</hi> But we have no reaſon to be dejected, ſo as to be diſquieted: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> indeed ſought for a reaſon, but hee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:120075:99"/>found none. He asked his ſoule, why it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted (implying, his judgement ſaw no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it:) But his ſoul doth not, (indeed could not) make any rationall anſwer. This queſtion ſilenceth his ſoule: As that in the Parable, <hi>why diddeſt not give my mony into the banke, that at my comming I might have required mine owne with</hi> uſury? Luk. 19.23. This queſtion ſtruck the idle ſervant dumb: So here, <hi>Why art caſt down?</hi> It ſtrikes the ſoule dumb, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer, nor give a reaſon for this dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, Why ſhould you be irrationall? why ſhould you give way to that, which you cannot give a reaſon for? You cannot at any time give any reaſon for your dejection, <hi>unto that diſquietneſſe, which we opened.</hi> Your caſe is not, cannot be miſerable. The Heathen could ſay: The Diety being reconciled to him, he could not be miſerable.</p>
               <q>Numine placato non miſer eſſe queo.</q>
               <p>Why, Saints! God is reconciled to you in Chriſt; you cannot be miſerable, being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: Ah!

               <p>Firſt, <hi>There is danger in giving way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, in regard of it ſelfe;</hi> It will get ground, and ſtrength, and the more its given way unto, the harder it will be to rule. Paſſion is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly beaſt, which muſt be curbed, and which if it have the reines looſe wil grow maſter-leſſe. Diſquiet is a diſeaſe, and a diſeaſe of that nature which increaſeth by degrees, and every increaſe thereof is dangerous; ſorrow wil quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow in caſe it be given way unto; its as a floud, which if not ſtopt wil ariſe, and over-flow all bankes. Spirituall dejection is the ſoules Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, now Conſumptions increaſe if given way unto. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Tis dangerous to give way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, in regard of Satan:</hi> hee'l get ground by dejection. Satan knowes how to make uſe of diſquiets; he would have ſorrowfull ſoules to give way unto ſorrow, that ſo ſorrow might <hi>ſwallow up</hi> the ſoule; (as tis, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.) The Apoſtle exhorts the Church to be tender of the dejected perſon (who as ſome thinke had been <hi>excommunicated,</hi> and filled with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and dejection thereupon) now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would have the Church to <hi>forgive,</hi>

Satan hath his devices, and one of them is to make the ſoule give way to dejection; then in the depth of dejection, he comes with temptations to deſpaire, and Self-murder, &amp;c. And in truth experience tells us, Satan hath a mighty advantage over us, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:120075:100"/>when we are dejected, and give way unto it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Its <hi>dangerous to give way to dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in regard of the ſoule;</hi> it loſeth ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. The ſoule is a great loſer by dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>The more its given way unto, the weaker the ſoule is.</hi> The ſoule much dejected is unfit for any ſervice; 'twas this that unfitted the Diſciples to watch; its ſaid, Chriſt <hi>found them ſleeping for ſorrow,</hi> Luk. 22.45. ſorrow brings one aſleep both Naturall, and Spirituall; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection cauſeth <hi>drowſineſſe.</hi> The ſoule when it gives way to dejection is thereby drowſie, and the drowſie ſoule is unfit for <hi>duty.</hi> Yea,</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The ſoule dejected is weakned unto war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</hi> Sad ſoules are not fit for ſouldiers; the cheerful ſoule is a <hi>Gyant refreſhed with Wine;</hi> it can fight the Lords Battels with courage: The ſad ſoule is liable unto cowardize. As the <hi>joy of the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> ſo the ſorrow of our ſpirits, is our weakneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The ſoule caſt downe is unfit for comfort;</hi> Sorrow given way unto ſhuts out joy, and the more roome the one hath, the leſſe is left for the other. Some ſoules when caſt downe are ſo full of ſorrow, that there is ſcarce a hole for comfort to enter; ſorrow where it rules, hath ſo many <hi>Centinels,</hi> and <hi>Guards;</hi> that its hard for comfort to get in, unleſſe it be by violence. A ſorrowful ſoule forgets to eate his bread, as the Pſalmiſt ſhewes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.4. or if the ſad ſoule comes to meat, it hath no <hi>ſtomack;</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:120075:101"/>we finde it by experience in naturall ſorrow, that it takes away our <hi>ſtomack.</hi> A ſad man ſits downe, and he is ſo full of ſorrow that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eate. Even ſo ſomtimes the ſad ſoule ſits downe at <hi>the Lords Table,</hi> and albeit the meat be choyce, <hi>(Manna from Heaven, and the fruit of the ſpirituall Vine Chriſt)</hi> yet the ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eate a crumb, nor drink a drop. O ſouls! minde it; the reaſon why you receive ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and yet finde ſo little, is becauſe you give way to caſtings down, your ſorrow takes away your ſouls ſtomack. As it ſometimes ſtops your mouthes, that you cannot open them (<hi>i. e.</hi> you cannot pray ſometimes, nor ſpeake a word to God, you are ſo caſt downe) ſo likewiſe at other times, it over-comes your appetite, it renders you unfit for comfort. Here is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (by the way) why you complaine ſo oft, you finde little refreſhing at <hi>breaking of Bread;</hi> you are ſo caſt downe, and give ſuch way unto it, that you have no ſtomack to eate, albeit Chriſt bid you welcome, and bids you eate abundantly.</p>
               <p>So that now then (to winde up this) you ſee both Scripture and reaſon; you have both to confirme this firſt branch of our point, that dejected ſoules ſhould not give way unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

               <p>YOu ſee now this proved, that when you are dejected, you ſhould not give way unto it; its too true, you are apt to doe it, but you ſee you ought not to do it. Ere I paſſe on to the next branch, I wil make uſe of this for two ends, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>

               <p>Firſt, let me as a friend (and in a friendly way) <hi>chide ſuch as being dejected, and caſt downe, doe give way thereunto.</hi> And there are five ſorts of ſoules to be chid for this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such as are caſt downe, and conceale as much</hi> (as in them lyes) <hi>their trouble, and the cauſe of it;</hi> hearken unto me you <hi>cloſe ſoules!</hi> who keep ſorrowes, yea and Satans ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; Why doe you give way to your griefe, and wil not make it knowne? Is there any comfort in your concealment? Is it not rather an adding affliction, to affliction? You ſad the hearts of your friends, while they ſee you diſquieted, and not willing to open your ſoule to theirs. Its the Apoſtles command (and I thinke 'twas in reference to this caſe) <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our faults one to another,</hi> James 5.16. what, is there none <hi>faithfull?</hi> will not any be <hi>friendly?</hi> why doe you conceale your ſorrow, and ſo feed it? Certainly, Satan and griefe get
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:120075:102"/>much by privacy; and you who conceale your dejection are to be reproved for giving way unto it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Such ſoules are alſo to be chid, who being caſt downe, never looke after, nor labour for comfort.</hi> He that is ſick and lookes not for a remedy, is guilty of giving way to the diſeaſe: And the ſoule that is ſad, and mindes not, nor ſeekes not for comfort, is guilty of <hi>giving way to dejection.</hi> Now how many are there who care not to heare, or read that which is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; its true, they love to heare, and read ſad things; <hi>Judgements, wrath, threatnings:</hi> But as for ſweet things, <hi>promiſes, experiences,</hi> or the like, alas! they looke not after them. Its obſerved of <hi>melancholly perſons,</hi> that they love to be in darke, <hi>and melancholly places,</hi> to heare ſad and dolefull Notes; the <hi>Owle,</hi> and <hi>Birds of the night</hi> are moſt delighted in by them: Even ſo, many ſad ſoules delight in the <hi>valley of death;</hi> they love not to heare the <hi>ſweet muſick of mercy, the delightfull notes of the Goſpel, the raviſhing raptures of joy, and peaceby beleeving;</hi> nothing pleaſeth them, but <hi>the thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, the terrors of the Law, the judgements of ſinners &amp;c.</hi> Surely you who doe this, are to be reproved, for hereby you give way unto your ſorrow and dejection, which thing you ought not to doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such ſoules as in their dejection ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and diſpute againſt their comfort, are guilty of giving way unto ſorrow.</hi> Sometimes we come to dejected ſoules, and tell them, we have a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:120075:102"/>commiſſion to comfort them. To this end, we indeavour to open the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Oath,</hi> that by thoſe two <hi>immutable things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, they might have ſtrong conſolation</hi> (as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18.) but alas! when we have ſaid much, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this ſhort and ſad anſwer, <hi>Comfort is not mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we reply; <hi>Why not yours?</hi> hath God any where excluded you?</p>
               <p>Yes, they ſay, <hi>we are ſhut up under unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,</hi> and there is no comfort for us.</p>
               <p>We anſwer; <hi>God hath ſhut up all under unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, that he might have mercy upon all,</hi> as tis, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.</p>
               <p>Nay but ſay they, <hi>God will not have mercy upon us;</hi> for alas! we are a people to whom mercy doth not belong.</p>
               <p>But we tell them againe, its ſaid; <hi>That they which in times paſt were not a people, are now the people of God, and they had not obtained mercy, now have obtained mercy,</hi> as it is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. yea, and we tel them, <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people, there ſhall they be called, the children of the living God,</hi> Rom. 9.26.</p>
               <p>But yet, when we have ſaid this, ſtill we are put off with denials, and contradictions; and ſtill we finde ſome ſaying, <hi>their ſoule refuſeth comfort:</hi> But minde it, who ever you are, you who thus diſpute againſt your comfort, you are to be <hi>chid;</hi> for he, or ſhe that diſputes againſt comfort, gives way (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:120075:103"/>to this point) unto ſorrow. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Dejected ſoules who love ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and avoyd ſociety, are to be chid alſo, for they give way to ſorrow.</hi> Satan gets by thy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſſe, thou ſhalt be ſure of his company, if thou wilt avoyd others company; thou maiſt goe from others but not from him, hee'l fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee into all the corners of thy retiredneſſe; couldeſt thou be alone, and without him, it were not ſo ill; but yet thy very being alone is not wel. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Vae Toh.</hi> i. e. <hi>Woe to the ſoule alone,</hi> Eccl. 4.10. wert thou in company, thy ſadneſſe might be ſweetned with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but being alone thy ſorrow wil eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter thee; and <hi>when thou art downe, thou wilt want another to take thee up,</hi> as tis there in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> Its a truth, that ſorrow ſeekes ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the ſad ſoul would be by it ſelfe: But God ſaw (even at firſt) <hi>it was not good for man to be alone;</hi> Its bad for the beſt, but moſt bad for the dejected ſoule to be by it ſelfe. Sorrow runs away (as I may ſay) apace with the ſoule if it be without company; but thus the ſoule ſhould not be, becauſe it muſt not give way to ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Such ſoules as in their dejections caſt off duties, to buy that give-way to ſorrow, and are therefore by this point to be chid.</hi> Diſquieted <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wil preach no more, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.9. and diſcontended <hi>Jonah,</hi> leaves Ninivey, and retires into the field; hee'l not preach to men, but rather <hi>fret againſt God.</hi> Oh! how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſoules are there who caſt off duties!
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:120075:103"/>
                  <hi>hearing, praying, receiving, &amp;c.</hi> and inſtead of waiting upon God in them for ſatisfaction, doe rather ſit and murmure impatiently againſt their God; bid them pray, indeed they ſay they cannot; but the truth is, <hi>will not</hi> (for could not they as wel ſpeake the ſame ſad complaints to God, that they doe to us?) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to heare, &amp;c. Alas! ſay they. <hi>Its in vaine, &amp;c.</hi> but this caſting off of duties, is a giving way to dejection, for to be cured of it we are to be up, and doing, as God tels <hi>Joſhua; Get thee up, wherefore lyeſt thou thus upon thy face,</hi> Judg 7.10. O ye caſt-downe ſoules, why lye you thus upon your faces? up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waite upon God in duties, ſo ſhall you be freed from your dejection. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, having thus friendly chid you, let me now faithfully counſell you: Take heed, and beware, O ye dejected hearts, how you give way unto your dejections; be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, be not caſt downe, ſtop your ſorrowes in ſeaſon; let not the flouds ariſe: you are indeed apt to let open the floud-gates of grief, but take heed leaſt it over-ſlow your ſoules. <hi>Davids</hi> practiſe bids you to be wiſe, and Chriſts precept commands you, not to let <hi>your hearts be troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>may not I give way to ſorrow, who have given way to ſinne?</hi> May I not be <hi>dejected</hi> much, who am <hi>defiled</hi> mightily? Suppoſe, (but why doe I make it a ſuppoſition? tis more, &amp;c.) that my heart ſmites me for ſinne, and I be dejected thereupon, ſhould not, ought
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:120075:104"/>not I to give way to ſorrow, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> By way of anſwer, ſuffer me, O ſoule, to ſay three things, and I beſeech you minde them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Tis poſſible for Satan to have a hand</hi> (Joab-<hi>like</hi>) <hi>in this matter;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See chap. 3 of this Section.</note> Satan knowes as wel how to gaine by <hi>ſorrow</hi> as by <hi>ſinne:</hi> and therefore he that put thee upon the one, may preſſe forward the other; even under the <hi>Straw-berry</hi> of <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> may lye the Serpent, to ſting unto deſpaire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Its true, you may, nay you muſt give way to ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> tis ſinne to ſtifle Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Many a wretch makes a ſport of ſinne, and ends his wickedneſſe as he began it, viz. <hi>with mirth:</hi> but this is <hi>madneſſe.</hi> Certainly, the faith of pardon cals for, and workes (if ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) the ſorrow of repentance, which is not to be repented of, nor ſpoken againſt; But yet,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>As you muſt give ſorrow way, ſo muſt you give faith way too.</hi> Its your wiſdome to know both when, and where to ſtop, you may give ſorrow too much way, even teares for ſinne may drown the ſoule; beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this, and learne to moderate your griefes.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay, How ſhall we know when ſorrow goes beyond its bounds;</hi> what Land mark is there by which we may know the duly ful tide of godly ſorrow? when muſt we ſtop the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of griefe, and ceaſe to give way unto our ſorrowes?</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:120075:104"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a myſtery, and you will never learne it of me, except the Spirit teach you; yet the letter of this myſtery lyes in three heads, or rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Then muſt ſorrow be ſtopped, and not given way unto, when it begins to worke deſpaire.</hi> Its time to wipe our eyes, and to leave off weeping, when we begin to be dimme-ſighted as to mercy; when ſorrow is gathered into clouds, to the darkening of grace; its time to ſtop.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When God begins to appeare alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in blackneſſe and darkneſſe,</hi> then its a time to rouze up our ſpirits from under dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas the ſoule ſees nothing but terrour and wrath, and is hereby diſ-heartened from duty, its high time to ſtop greife; if your ſoules begin to be ſo ſad, <hi>as to be afraid to goe to God,</hi> to ſpeake to him, to argue (boldly through the Goſpel) with him, then its time to doubt, and feare that your ſorrow is gone too farre, and that you have given way to it too much.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>when ſadneſſe makes you ſtand off from Chriſt;</hi> when it begets ſo much feare, as to keep under faith, then certainely it is too much, and it muſt be ſtopped. Tell me, O ſoule, that mourneſt for ſinne, that art dejected and caſt downe, for thy defilement and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. <hi>Art afraid to beleeve? Art loath to goe to Chriſt? Doſt begin to queſtion his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to receive, and pardon thee? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon doſt begin to thinke now thou art caſt downe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:120075:105"/>to ariſe no more? to lye in thy ſorrowes till thou dye? And doſt thinke it in vaine to goe to Chriſt, and impoſſible to be accepted by Chriſt?</hi> Know, that now certainly thy ſorrow is gone too farre, and that now thou not only mayeſt, but that thou oughteſt, and muſt ſtop it; now its thy wiſedome, and ſhould be thy care to let it goe no further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But me thinkes I heare thee ſay; <hi>Alas! I would ſtop greife if I could;</hi> I would ceaſe to be ſorrowfull, had I a skill; <hi>How ſhall I bridle my paſſion? How ſhall I keep downe my diſquiet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To doe this I confeſſe is difficult; ſorrow is a ſtubborne paſſion, and its not an eaſie thing to bridle it; waters are not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maſtered: But yet, take two or three helps.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>begin to ſtop inordinate griefe quickly;</hi> Its eaſier to ſtop the Horſe at his firſt ſetting out then afterwards: Griefe gets ſtrength by any ſufferance, <hi>give it not place therefore, no not for an houre.</hi> It hath been noted, that ſuch as have craved, and had leave to weep, and be ſad a little, have taken more liberty then was allowed, and have wept a great deale more then was fit; <hi>lay a reſtraint therefore upon ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in its firſt ſwelling, ſo ſhall it not over-flow the bankes of thy ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, (as a helpe to this) <hi>Conſider how your inordinate dejection goes to the heart of Chriſt;</hi> ſometimes the wife is prevailed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all not to be too ſad, becauſe it grieves the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:120075:105"/>husband; Pray wife, ſaith the husband, be not ſo ſad and melancholly, it troubles me to ſee it, &amp;c. This ſtops ſorrow many times; Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it (ye <hi>ſpirituall Spouſes</hi>) your husband <hi>(Chriſt)</hi> is <hi>troubled to ſee you ſo ſad,</hi> it goes to his heart to ſee you ſo dejected. Chriſt ſpeaks of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that <hi>his ſoule was diſquieted</hi> (for tis the ſame word in the originall with that in the text) <hi>for him;</hi> ſurely did you but ſeriouſly conſider this, it would ſtop your griefe, and cauſe, and keepe you from giving way unto it, in as much as Chriſt is caſt downe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted (as it were) to ſee you ſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Call your ſoule to an account;</hi> this wil prevent it for going further. The way to prevent exorbitant expences in Stewards, is to call them to an account: O poore ſoules learne, and practiſe the Art of <hi>ſelfe expoſtulation,</hi> ſay to your ſelves as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Why art thou caſt downe</hi> (O my ſoule) <hi>and why art thou ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within me?</hi> This wil be a good way to keepe downe ſorrow from riſing too high, yea and a good way to raiſe up your ſoule from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too low. Indeed this is the other branch of the point, and I ſhall now come unto it.</p>

                  <hi>How?</hi> i. e. <hi>O how art thou caſt downe. O my ſoule?</hi> I wonder at it, and its an aſtoniſhment to me to conſider it; how ſad, how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſad art thou, O my poore dejected ſoule? Or elſe:</p>

               <p>I Wil a little touch upon theſe two heads for the clearly underſtanding of this branch.</p>

                  <item>1 <hi>Wherein doth this expoſtulation, or arguing with our ſoules conſiſt?</hi>

               <p>For the firſt, you wil ſay (If it <hi>be our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſhould be our care when caſt downe, to argue the caſe with our ſelves</hi>) wherein doth this arguing conſiſt?</p>
               <p>Now for this, know, that this expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth principally conſiſt in three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In a ſolemne ſummoning of the ſoule to give an account of its dejection.</hi> Wee ſhould, (Judge-like) call our ſoules before us, and demand what is the reaſon that it breakes the <hi>royall law of love,</hi> which commands us to <hi>rejoyce alway;</hi> And it ſleights Chriſts command of not <hi>being troubled.</hi> I know the ſad heart is backward unto this, but we muſt ſummon it ſolemnly <hi>in the name of Chriſt</hi> to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that a faithfull one, why its ſo ſad and caſt downe? we ſhould ſay, <hi>Come forth</hi> (O my ſoule) <hi>out of thy ſad and ſolitary retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and tell me plainly the reaſon why thou art caſt downe, and alſo the end that thou aymeſt at, &amp;c.</hi> This is the firſt part, or introduction to this arguing. The</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:120075:107"/>
               <p>Second is, <hi>A due conſideration of the cauſe, or reaſon which the ſoule gives for its dejection.</hi> Peradventure the cauſe may not be a <hi>cauſe,</hi> the reaſon may not be <hi>rationall;</hi> or if it be a <hi>cauſe</hi> it may not be ſo <hi>great;</hi> therefore we ſhould weigh what, and how weighty it is. As to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſometimes the ſoule ſaith its dejected, for this <hi>croſſe,</hi> or for that <hi>affliction;</hi> for this <hi>feare,</hi> and that <hi>fall;</hi> for this <hi>corruption,</hi> and that <hi>temptation, &amp;c.</hi> now then, the maine part of this expoſtulation lyes in our weighing and right ſtating of the cauſe, which the ſoule ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, or thinkes it hath, for its dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this arguing lyeth <hi>in doing of what we are able to doe, to ſatisfie our ſelves.</hi> Its ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>he comforted himſelfe in his God,</hi> 1 Sam. 30.6. That is, he ſtrengthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as well as he could. Its certaine, that in a naturall way we may doe ſomething, and in a ſupernaturall way we may doe more; now we ſhould ſtir up our gifts both naturall, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall. <hi>Incourage your ſelves</hi> (as I read it) <hi>and he ſhall ſtrengthen your hearts,</hi> Pſal. 31. laſt,<note place="margin">

                  </note> to ſatisfie our ſelves in the pretended cauſes of our dejections. Beſides, we <hi>ſhould charge our ſouls to be patient, and ſtirre up our ſelves to beleeve;</hi> we ſhould doe what we can Logically to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve doubts,<note place="margin">Significat obourare fortem eſſe.</note> (<hi>i. e.</hi> fully to ſatisfie trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) and Rhetorically to perſwade (as it were) our ſelves to rejoyce. <hi>There is enough
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:120075:108"/>in the Scriptures to ſilence all ſorrowes, and to ſatisfie all caſes;</hi> and we ſhould argue from the Scriptures for this purpoſe, as much, and as wel as we can. We ſhould not plead for, but againſt our dejections; we ſhould ſtrengthen the hands of our faith againſt <hi>unbeleefe,</hi> and the grounds of joy againſt <hi>ſorrow.</hi> Its true, its Chriſt alone that can raiſe us, but yet we muſt ſtrive in our expoſtulation to raiſe our ſelves; <hi>Shake thy ſelfe from the duſt, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> as it is, <hi>Iſay</hi> 52.2. The children of Sion muſt ſhake themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> doe themſelves (what in them lyes) towards their owne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and raiſing from dejections.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt thing, you may now gueſſe wherein this expoſtulation lyes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing followes, i. e. <hi>Why ſhould dejected ſoules thus expoſtulate the matter with themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this I might give many reaſons, I ſhall inſtance briefly in theſe five.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe God hath given to men as men, much more to Saints as Saints, a power and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to expoſtulate with themſelves.</hi> Men have a judgement, and conſcience, and ſurely theſe things ſhould be made uſe of, and improved, as in other particulars, ſo likewiſe in this. Its the priviledge of <hi>men above beaſts,</hi> that they have a <hi>naturall faculty,</hi> to argue, and reaſon buſineſſes within themſelves; and its the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of <hi>Saints above men,</hi> that they can caſt a reſtraint upon themſelves (as Doctor <hi>Sibs</hi> obſerved upon this text) now its reaſon that we
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:120075:108"/>ſhould reaſon the caſe with our ſoules, fith God hath given us a faculty ſo to doe. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Dejected ſoules ſhould argue the caſe with themſelves, becauſe many times they ſhall finde they are dejected cauſ-leſſe;</hi> As wicked men are ſometimes in feare where no feare is, <hi>i. e.</hi> where there is no juſt cauſe of feare. So Saints are ſometimes dejected, when they have no juſt cauſe for it. Its certaine, that take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the ſence formerly opened, a Saint hath never a juſt ground for it. <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Wherefore ſhould be feare in the dayes of evill, when the iniquity of his heeles compaſſe him about,</hi> Pſal. 49.5. his meaning is, even then when all his ſins did compaſſe him, he had no cauſe to be afraid, or caſt downe; But certainly many times even Saints are dejected for no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, now we ſhould therefore expoſtulate with our ſelves: Its but a homely compariſon (yet ſith it comes home to the matter ile uſe it) Sometimes we are <hi>as fearefull Horſes, who flight and ſtartle at every buſh and ſhadow;</hi> we feare even the ſhadowes of feare, and we are caſt downe, when there is no ſubſtantiall ground. Its but meet therefore that when we are caſt downe we ſhould argue the caſe with our ſelves, and ſee what reaſon there is for it, and what weight is in that reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>By reaſoning or arguing with our ſeules, we lay a ſtop in ſorrowes way;</hi> looke as it is in the point of finning, ſo is it in the buſineſſe of ſorrow. If ſinners would but a little expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with themſelves, they would not run on in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:120075:109"/>ſinne,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> therefore the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Stand in awe and ſinne not, commune</hi> (or expoſtulate) <hi>with your ſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> Pſal. 4.4. In like manner, Saints would not give way unto ſadneſſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> ſpeake in your. hearts.</note> if they did but commune, and reaſon the caſe with themſelves. Did Saints but reaſon with ſorrow thus; <hi>Why art thou? whither tendeſt thou? what ſweet is in thee, &amp;c?</hi> ſurely ſuch a reaſoning as this, it would at leaſt reſtraine ſorrow, and keep it under. And to this,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Christians or Saints caſt downe ſhould thus reaſon with themſelves, becauſe this will be ſome excuſe for them if they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</hi> That ſoule that gives way to ſadneſſe, and in no kinde ſtrives againſt, and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with it, hath no excuſe to plead; as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that ruſh into ſinne violently, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>(as the horſe into the battell)</hi> they have no excuſe. Its ſome (though but a ſmall) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that a ſoule can ſay, I ſtrived againſt temptation, I oppoſed corruption, I expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with my ſoule againſt it; ſo a ſoule that is carried downe the <hi>ſtreame of ſorrow,</hi> may plead a little for its ſelfe, if it hath done its beſt againſt it; whereas if it gives way, and expoſtulates not the matter at all, its inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ſoule may with ſome boldneſſe call for, and with ſome confidence expect helpe from Chriſt, to raiſe it being caſt downe, in caſe it can plead, That it hath ſtrived, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with it ſelfe as well as it could. Then,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>A ſoule dejected ſhould argue the caſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:120075:109"/>with its ſelfe, becauſe hereby he is fitter for cure.</hi> This ſelfe-expoſtulation renders the minde wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be convinced, and it doth alſo make the ſoule fitter to open its caſe and condition. Like as the perſon that hath examined, and found out his diſeaſe, is fitter for to make it known, and ſo to be cured: So is the ſoule that hath expoſtulated the buſineſſe of his dejection with himſelfe. Many poore ſoules are not able to open their caſes, and one maine reaſon is, they never did argue it with themſelves, but ſtill let it run on, till they are caſt downe into a pit where they cannot ſee; in as much therefore that ſelfe-expoſtulation doth ſo advantage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſoules as to cure, and ſatisfaction, its but <hi>reaſon that they ſhould</hi> uſe it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This truth reproves ſuch as being caſt downe, never doe thus.</hi> Its the fault, and folly of many dejected hearts, that they take it for granted and ſure, that they may, and ought to be caſt downe, and therefore they never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:120075:110"/>into the matter, nor expoſtulate, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the thing at all; they cry out, oh! <hi>they are caſt downe;</hi> but they never ſay, <hi>Why,</hi> or <hi>wherefore?</hi> This they take for granted, they have cauſe. Surely you are to be reproved who goe ſad, and heavie all the day long, and never argue with your ſelves, <hi>Why is it?</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Be ſerious and ſolemne,</hi> charge your ſoules againe, and againe, ſo doth <hi>David</hi> here; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, here is not one <hi>why,</hi> but two <hi>whyes;</hi> Firſt, <hi>Why caſt downe?</hi> Secondly, <hi>Why troubled? why</hi> and <hi>why;</hi> O be you very ſerious, and <hi>keepe your hearts to it.</hi> Doe not let thy heart be quiet, till it indeed diſcover unto thee, the true reaſon of its ſadneſſe.</item>
                  <item>2 <hi>Be very cautious and ſober, doe not diſpute too much, nor inquire too farre;</hi> Satan wil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute too long, and bring you into <hi>Labyrinths</hi> which you cannot get out off. <hi>Doe not dive into the Divine decrees;</hi> If thy ſoule ſay, Its ſad by thinking on them; tell thy ſoule, that thoſe things are <hi>above thy reach,</hi> and therefore are not to cauſe thy ſorrow. If thy ſoule urge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and poſitions about <hi>Predeſtination, &amp;c.</hi> be not too curious to pry into thoſe particulars, nor to diſpute thoſe caſes; tell thy ſoule, <hi>The Word is night thee. even in thy heart;</hi> and that this is the word of the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. <hi>That Jeſus
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:120075:110"/>Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 <hi>Beware how you conclude againſt your ſoule, becauſe you cannot ſatisfie your ſelfe.</hi> Tis poſſible thy caſe may be ſatisfiable, and yet thou art not able to doe it. Doe not ſay, I may, and I muſt be caſt downe, for I cannot ſay any thing to the contrary, I cannot ſatisfie my doubts, and feares, &amp;c. Why though thou canſt not, others may; The Pſalmiſt tells you of a caſe that was <hi>too hard for him</hi> to reſolve himſelfe in, and yet when he went to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary he had ſatisfaction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16, 17. O poore ſoules! you may not be able after all your expoſtulation to ſatisfie your ſelves, yet doe not conclude againſt your ſelves, but goe to the Sanctuary, and you ſhall have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction there.</item>
                  <item>4 <hi>Beware of partiality;</hi> Heare as wel what may be ſaid <hi>for,</hi> as what is ſaid <hi>againſt</hi> your ſoules; You have a willing ſpirit, though a weake fleſh; you have a waking heart, though a ſleepy head; you are comely though <hi>black.</hi> Heare as wel <hi>pro,</hi> as <hi>con;</hi> receive as wel argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for your ſelves, as inſinuations againſt your ſelves: Surely its not only your <hi>wiſdome,</hi> but your <hi>duty.</hi> You muſt as wel argue for lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings up for what there is in you of Chriſt, as for caſtings downe, for what there is in you of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. You are not juſt Arbitrators, not righteous in expoſtulation, if you argue not <hi>both parts;</hi> therefore in your arguing beware of partiality, its a needfull caution. O how many cry out, <q>
                        <hi>O they ſleep, they are black;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:120075:111"/>they have this corruption, and they wreſtle with that temptation;</hi>
                     </q> but never minde what watchfulneſſe, what comlineſſe, what grace, what helpe, &amp;c. they have from Chriſt; and its no wonder that they are caſt downe.: But beware of this partiality in your expoſtulation with your ſelves.</item>
                  <item>5 <hi>Make the Goſpel the Judge of your caſe;</hi> let not the Law, but let Grace moderate your diſpute. While you argue the caſe with your ſoule, take heed of <hi>Moſes,</hi> hee'l caſt you down lower; if he moderate. But appeale to Chriſt, by him comes <hi>grace and truth;</hi> hee'l decide the controverſie truly (and if ſinne have the truth,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> hee'l acknowledge it unto repentance) but hee'l decide it alſo graciouſly (and <hi>where ſinne abounds,</hi> hee'l ſay, <hi>grace ſuperabounds unto faith</hi>) therefore in your ſelf-ſoule-expoſtulation bring your heart into the preſence of Chriſt, and let him alone be Judge.</item>
                  <item>6 <hi>Reſolve never to conclude finally againſt thy ſoule, whatever at preſent may be proved againſt it,</hi> When thy ſoule hath ſaid all that it can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy ſtate, and when after all that thou haſt anſwered, thy ſoule is unſatisfied; nay, ſuppoſe thou finde every thing punctually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a reaſon for dejection, yet reſolve to conclude nothing againſt thy ſelfe, <hi>for God can help at laſt,</hi> though Satan ſhould be righteous in his accuſation, and thy conſcience joyn with him, in witneſſing againſt thee, yet know, <hi>Chriſt is righteous in thy abſolution, and his bloud can cleanſe thy conſcience, yea and it ſhall,</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:120075:111"/>Heb. 10. But you will ſay, <hi>What if in my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation I finde my owne conſcience condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me,</hi> muſt I reſolve not to conclude of my eſtate by that?</item>
               </list>

                  <hi>Anſ. No not finally;</hi> thy conſcience may condemne thee <hi>now,</hi> and yet <hi>acquit thee anon:</hi> Nay, Chriſt may permit firſt thy owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to condemne thee, that afterwards thou maiſt ſee, and prize his <hi>grace</hi> in acquitting thee.</p>
               <p>Well, theſe be the rules to mannage your ſelfe-argumentation, I wil give a few words more to direct you in the argumentation it ſelfe, and then ile conclude this Section.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Informe your ſoules, that it ſhall not be alwaies thus;</hi> tell them, you ſhall not alway ſit diſconſolate (<hi>as a woman forſaken, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſpirit,</hi> as tis, <hi>Iſay</hi> 54.6.)

               <p>Thus be directed in your dejections to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, or expoſtulate with your owne ſoules as <hi>David</hi> doth, but withall remember to argue with God alſo; ſo doth <hi>David</hi> likewiſe, <hi>I will ſpeake unto God my rock</hi> (ſaith he) ſo doe thou, goe to God, and humbly expoſtulate with him; if thou art dejected by reaſon of a deſertion; go and ſay, <hi>Why haſt thou forgotten me?</hi> Aske God why he eclipſeth his face; If thou art dejected by reaſon of temptation, ſay, <hi>Why goe I mourning by reaſon of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:120075:113"/>of the enemy?</hi> Thou maiſt be bold with God in Chriſts bloud, therefore ariſe (O caſt downe ſoule) and goe to God, and argue out thy cauſe with him; intreat him to take off his hand if it keep thee downe, and beſeech him, to ſtretch forth his hand to raiſe thee up.

               <p>Why it may be ſo, <hi>yet you muſt waite with patience,</hi> you muſt tarry the Lords leaſure: he wil not let you alway to lye, and labour in your dejections; but hee'l come and raiſe you up.

               <head type="sub">An Explication of the worke of waiting.</head>
               <p>DEjected ſoules! I am ſpeaking to you. I have told you already, <hi>you muſt not give way to your dejections.</hi> I now tell you more, <hi>You muſt be content to waite.</hi> If you aske what this is?</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly, that this worke conſiſts in four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In a patient bearing of that ſadneſſe, and dejection under which you are.</hi> Every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is impatient, Soules caſt down are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in the pit; but this ſhould not be. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> tells you, of his ſinking into a <hi>deep pit;</hi> and that in it he cryed, till he was weary, yet he did patiently <hi>wait. I am weary</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of my crying; my throat is dryed, mine eyes faile</hi> (yet marke what followes) I <hi>wait for my God, Pſal.</hi> 69.3. Hee was not ſo impatient, as not to waite, And the Church ſaith, ſhe'l <hi>bear the indignation of the Lord,</hi> as it is <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:120075:115"/>ſouls! you muſt waite in patience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>You muſt be content to tarry.</hi> As you muſt patiently bear, ſo you muſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly forbear. The word ſignifies as much, and is ſo uſed, and tranſlated, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>ſtaid yet other ten dayes.</hi> He had ſent forth one Dove before, and that returns quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe ſhe found no reſt for the ſole of her foot. He did not preſently ſend forth another, no, he ſtayd <hi>ten dayes</hi> (ſaith the text.) After the ſecond returned, with an olive branch, and ſo gave ſome hope, yet he was not over forward to ſend forth a third. No, he <hi>ſtaid ten dayes</hi> for that likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Dejected hearts, you muſt do as <hi>Noah</hi> did, <hi>i.e.</hi> be content to ſtay a while. Indeed the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exile maketh haſt, he feares to dye in the pit, and that his bread will fail, as tis <hi>Eſa.</hi> 51.14. But we ſhould not make haſt. We ought to be content to tarry the Lords leiſure, wee muſt as well waite and forbeare God (as I may ſay) till he come with cure, and comfort, as bear our own caſting down. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This duty lyes alſo, <hi>In a diligent obſervation of God, as he comes in with cure, and comfort.</hi> Unto me (ſaith Job) <hi>men gave ere, and waited</hi> (its the ſame word with this in the text) <hi>i.e.</hi> they obſerved what I ſpake, And again (ſaith he) <hi>they waited for me as for the rain</hi> chap. 29.21, 23. His meaning is, as men who looke out for <hi>raine, obſerve and eye every cloud:</hi> So did they wait: <hi>i. e.</hi> obſerve and eye every <hi>word of mine.</hi> This lyes in the word, <hi>which is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:120075:115"/>to wait ſo, as to looke out for.</hi> The Prophet ſtands upon his watch-tower, and looks out for the viſion of which he ſpeaks, and for which he would have us waite. <hi>As the eies of ſervants looke unto their Maſters: So our eies waite upon the Lord our God,</hi> Pſal. 123.2. <hi>My ſoul waits for the Lord, and in his word do I hope;</hi> But how? marke it, <hi>more then they that do watch for the morning,</hi> Pſ. 130.5, 6. You know ſuch as do watch for the morning, eye, and look out for any dawning, any glimering. Souls caſt down ſhould ſee how the Lord appears towards their raiſing, they ſhould eye diligently how he comes forth for their cure. <hi>His going forth is prepared as the morning,</hi> as it is Hoſ. 6.3. Therefore in our waiting for him, or on him, we ſhould doe as thoſe that do <hi>watch for day,</hi> i.e. obſerve exactly, every <hi>glimering</hi> of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is one thing more in the word, and worke,</hi> and that is <hi>hope.</hi> Dejected ſoules ſhould thus <hi>bear,</hi> and <hi>forbear,</hi> and <hi>looke out,</hi> but all <hi>in, and with hope.</hi> Thus the word is tranſlated here: <hi>[hope] thou in God.</hi> So its tranſlated and uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81. <hi>My ſoule fainteth for thy ſalvation, but [I hope] in thy word.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (you caſt down Chriſtians!) you ought to <hi>hope in your loweſt eſtate,</hi> you muſt hope for that which yet you have not, i.e. <hi>cure,</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> you muſt ſay, <hi>I am caſt down, but I hope to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I am diſquieted, but I hope I ſhall be ſettled.</hi> You muſt not caſt away your confidence, in your moſt troubled condition.</p>
               <p>Theſe things put together, you will know
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:120075:116"/>your worke, which is in your <hi>deepeſt dejections, to be patient; and not to murmur: To be content to tarry Gods time, and not to haſten releife: To looke out, and eie how God appeares towards you, and for you. And to do all this with hope that yet you ſhall be raiſed, and ſettled.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Some grounds of the point.</head>
               <p>WE may peradventure think this ſtrange but yet tis true: And albeit we may conceive it a rigorous thing, yet tis <hi>rationall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And there are many reaſons why a ſoule caſt down, ſhould be content thus to <hi>bear, tarry,</hi> and <hi>expect, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not name all that I could, theſe may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Its Gods will:</hi> Hee wills that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all (and in this caſe) we ſhould waite: And his <hi>will is the higheſt reaſon.</hi> The people of God were much dejected when in <hi>Babylon:</hi> yet <hi>then</hi> (and with reference to that it was that) <hi>God commanded them to waite,</hi> Habba. 2.3. Hee that commandeth <hi>converſion,</hi> commands alſo <hi>waiting. Turn to thy God</hi> (ſaith he) I, but it may be (might the ſoule ſay) God will not turn to me, yet marke it, <hi>wait on thy God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,</hi> Hoſea 12.6. Its true, God will <hi>cure,</hi> and <hi>raiſe</hi> dejected ſoules, but <hi>hee'l take his own time.</hi> Therefore we ought, and we muſt, be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:120075:116"/>content to tarry and waite in hope. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Its but equall that we ſhould waite and expect becauſe we caſt our ſelves downe.</hi> For the moſt part our dejections are our own (as I formerly noted,) we throw our ſelves down, and its but meet we ſhould expect, and wait patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly til God will raiſe us up. Beſides</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>We are not alwayes fit for comfort.</hi> We are not always prepared for a raiſed eſtate, and therefore we may be content with a caſt down one. <hi>The Lord waits to be gracious:</hi> as it is <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.18. God is fain to tarry till we are fit for to be raiſed: and ſurely, if he tarry with, we ſhould be content to tarry for, a cure. Thou dejected heart conſider; <hi>thou art not fit to be out of the pit:</hi> thy ſadneſſe at preſent ſuits beſt with thy ſtate. Thou art not able to mannage joy: Nor as yet art thou skilfull how to carry thy ſelf in a ſublime and raiſed condition. Now God waits on thee for this end, that he may fit thee for joy, and fil thee with joy: why then ſhouldeſt not thou upon this account be content to waite, and expect in hope and patience?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Soules in their deepeſt dejections, ſhould be content to waite and expect, &amp;c. becauſe they cannot raiſe nor helpe themſelves.</hi> The child that is down, and cannot raiſe it ſelfe, muſt be content to lye: ſhould it cry and ſtruggle never ſo much, yet it could not helpe its ſelfe. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians dejected in ſpirit, you <hi>are as children, you cannot raiſe your ſelves.</hi> Its true you can fall of your ſelves (even without Satan) you can create troubles and fears without him (and its
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:120075:117"/>your fault and folly that too oft you do ſo) But yet though you can deject your ſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of Satan; you cannot raiſe your ſelves without the power of God: <hi>why ſtrive you and cry you in vain.</hi> Till God <hi>create peace,</hi> you cannot injoy it, you ſhould therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to tarry and waite his leiſure.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>It argues humility to be thus content,</hi> Proud <hi>Benhadad</hi> will not waite: <hi>what</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſhall I waite for the Lord any longer,</hi> 2 King. 6. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lt.</hi> Its the ſame word with this in the Text. His meaning is; hee'l not be patient, nor tarry, nor expect and hope any longer. But though <hi>proud Benhadad</hi> will not, yet <hi>humble David</hi> would, and did. A ſoule that is humble, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to tarry <hi>dayes, weeks, years</hi> for the Lord. If God will not raiſe him now, hee'l <hi>wait in hope,</hi> that he may hereafter. It argues a ſoule too much lifted up, that cannot be content to lye, till God will take it up. <hi>Habbakkuk,</hi> after he had ſaid, we muſt wait for the viſion: addes, <hi>His ſoul which is lifted up is not right,</hi> ch. 2.4. He bids us <hi>behold this,</hi> i.e. conſider it, that it argues a <hi>proud and a rotten heart, that cannot, will not wait.</hi> A lowly mind, becomes a low eſtate. If your condition be low, and you <hi>caſt down,</hi> you muſt be ſo lowly, <hi>as to be content,</hi> to wait and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in hope, with patience.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>God tarryed at firſt a long time for our riſing from ſin, and its but juſt, that we ſhould tarry a while, for our raiſing from ſorrow.</hi> How long (O caſt down ſoule) did God waite and expect thy converſion? why ſhouldeſt not thou
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:120075:117"/>be content to waite for his conſolation? Chriſt expected the fruits of the Spirit unto holineſſe a great while; and ſhouldeſt not thou expect, and waite for the fruite of the Spirit unto joy a little? Surely its but reaſon we ſhould waite with patience, till God raiſe us out of the pits of ſadneſſe and dejection; ſith he waited long for our riſing out of the pits of ſinfulneſſe and defilement.</p>

               <p>On the one hand, <hi>your mourning is as thoſe that have no hope;</hi> and on the other, <hi>you mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,</hi> as thoſe <hi>who have no patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But both theſe extreames ſhould be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for as the former point tells you, you ſhould reaſon with your ſelves, and not give way to mourning; ſo this tells you, that you ſhould in patience poſſeſſe your ſoules, and at no hand give way to murmuring.</p>
               <p>I wiſh you would, and could make the right uſe of this point; I ſhall touch at three uſes which you ought to make, and Chriſt help you that you may.</p>
               <p>The uſes are, For
<list>
                     <item>1 <hi>Humiliation,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 <hi>Caution, and</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This point might ſerve to humble thoſe who doe not as they ſhould;</hi> I meane, ſuch as are dejected, and yet wil not waite in patience with hope. How oft is it that they cry out, <hi>Their caſe is inſufferable, and they'l not beare it; and their condition is deſperate, and its in vaine for them to hope?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But be humbled (O yee ſad ſoules) for theſe ſpeeches; you heare what <hi>David</hi> did, and you ſhould do: you hear what others have done in your caſe, and what you ſhould doe too, and let this humble you for your fayling.</p>
               <p>Why ſayeſt thou, O <hi>Jacob;</hi> and ſpeakeſt thou, O <hi>Iſrael, My way is bid from the Lord,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:120075:118"/>and my judgement is paſſed over from my God,</hi> (as it is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.27.) <hi>Have you not heard that your Father fainteth not, and that he giveth power to the faint? Have you not heard that the youths faint; and that yet they that waite upon the Lord renew their ſtrength?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Have you not heard that <hi>David</hi> was deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as you are) and that yet he did beare, and forbeare, in patience and hope (as you ſhould) O be you humbled for not doing as he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>Davids</hi> caſe was not as mine my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is ſorer then his; he had not ſo great grounds to be caſt downe as I have, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Why ſayeſt thou ſo (O ſad ſoule!) thou conſidereſt thine owne, but not his; doe but conſider his ſeriouſly, and then compare.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He was now baniſhed from his houſe, yea and from Gods too; he was now in the Wilderneſſe <hi>(where no waters were)</hi> and hee was now deprived of <hi>Sion,</hi> in which were all his ſprings. Yea,</p>
               <p>Secondly, as he wanted meanes, ſo he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more, <hi>i. e.</hi> he wanted God, he ſaw not that face which his ſoule ſought; he was at preſent in the darke. A <hi>Wilderneſſe</hi> is ſad in the <hi>day time,</hi> but more ſad in the night; <hi>David</hi> now wanted Divine diſcoveries, ſay now, is thy dejection more grounded than his? nay,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God was not only wanting, but wrathfull; <hi>David</hi> was not only farre from the <hi>ſprings of love,</hi> but he was under the <hi>ſpouts of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:120075:119"/>warth;</hi> and all Gods billowes or waves went over him. Adde to this,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Davids</hi> enemies tooke notice of this, and ſcoffed at him all the while; and this as a ſword did peirce him, as tis, verſ. 9.</p>
               <p>Conſider now (O ſoule) was not <hi>Davids</hi> caſe as bad as yours? Or can you ſay your grounds of dejection are as great as his? what ſay you O ſoules for your ſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Though his caſe were as bad as ours, yet our ſtrength is not ſo great as his; as his burden was ſo heavie as ours, ſo our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are not ſo ſtrong as his: Doe you expect <hi>children</hi> ſhould beare as much as <hi>men,</hi> and not ſinke, and cry, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But ſtay (O ſoule) and conſider, that albeit I ſhould ſay, <hi>David</hi> was ſtronger then you; yet,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Davids</hi> ſtrength was not his own; it was Gods hand that ſupported him; and his hand is under thee: It may be thou ſeeſt the one hand (which is over, or upon thee) but thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt alſo conſider, the other hand (that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee.) Beſides,</p>
               <p>Secondly, God knowes your ſtrength, and beyond that hee'l not ſuffer you to be tryed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. yea, the eternall God is thy ſtrength, and underneath are thy everlaſting armes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.27. Chriſt who is ſtrong (O ſoule) wil beare thee up, and his ſtrength is to be <hi>perfected in thy weakneſſe;</hi> and in time thou ſhouldeſt finde it, couldeſt thou but in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience waite with hope.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:120075:119"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Nay, but I cannot doe that, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope for helpe, ſith I ſee no doore for <hi>hope</hi> to enter, I ſhall goe ſoftly all my yeares in the bitterneſſe of my ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid ſo in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but he was deceived, and ſo art thou: when thy ſtrength is gone, and thou ſhut up, ſo as that thou ſeeſt no hope, Chriſt may, and wil come; therefore put not the uſe off, but take it to thy ſelfe (O impatient, deſpairing, deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted one!) thou art to be humbled, ſith thou doſt not carry thy ſelfe as <hi>David</hi> did, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this point is a caution to all; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, or expecting dejection, to take heed they do not mis-behave themſelves under Gods hand.</p>
               <p>Thy duty of waiting (I told you) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in foure things, take heed of failing in either</p>
               <p>Firſt, it lay in a patient bearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O take heed of impatience in your dejections: Beware of paſſionate words, and actions, in your dejected condition; doe not ſay in thy haſte, <hi>that thou art cast downe, and ſhalt be cut off,</hi> as tis, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. Doe not ſay, I thought indeed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and friends had been faithfull in their comforts, and counſels; but I ſee now that <hi>all men are lyars,</hi> as tis, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. Thou haſt heard of the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> how that in all this (i. e. this ſad condition) <hi>he did not charge God fooliſhly,</hi> Job 1.22. O take heed, that thou be not wiſe in thine owne eye, and ſay,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:120075:120"/>
                  <hi>Why am I thus, if the Lord be with me?</hi> Surely this is impatience, and in this you charge God with folly; beware of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in your dejection take heed of haſte, you ſhould waite, and tarry; bee wary of a haſty ſpirit: Remember, <hi>he that beleeveth maketh not haſte,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. <hi>David</hi> often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of his haſte. Take heed of <hi>Sauls</hi> mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that would not tarry till <hi>Samuel</hi> came; beware thou be not as <hi>Benhadad,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Why ſhould I waite any longer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, take heed alſo of neglect in eying incomes, doe not ſay, its in vaine to looke up to the Hils, from whence commeth help; what though thine eyes have looked long, and faile, yet looke longer. Indeed, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid, his <hi>eyes did faile with looking, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 38.14. yet ſalvation did not faile at laſt. O take heed of leaving off to looke, and expect in every duty, in every ordinance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, beware of deſpaire; doe not ſay <hi>my hope is periſhed from the Lord:</hi> Indeed the Church in her lamentable eſtate ſaid ſo, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 3.18. But it was becauſe <hi>ſhe remembred her affiction, and miſery, her wormwood, and gall,</hi> Theſe things ſhe had ſtill in remembrance, (as tis there, verſ. 19, 20.) But thou oughteſt to turne to thy ſoule, for ſo I tranſlate, verſ. 21. i. e. to doe as <hi>David</hi> here, returne and reaſon with thy ſoule, and then thou wilt have hope. Beware of that heavie word <hi>deſpaire,</hi> ſay not thy caſe is hopeleſſe; what, is there no Balme in <hi>Gilead?</hi> Caſt not, oh caſt not away your
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:120075:120"/>
                  <hi>confidence. But hear a little, forbeare, hunger, looke out, and hope:</hi> for thou ſhalt yet <hi>praiſe God,</hi> And therefore.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Be ye exhorted</hi> (all yee caſt downe ſoules) <hi>to this duty, which is in hope and patience, to waite upon Chriſt in all your dejections.</hi> Learn to tarry the Lords leiſure. Do not onely waite with <hi>patience,</hi> but with <hi>contentment,</hi> Say I will bear the hand of the Lord: and bee contented (ſith its his pleaſure) to be in a dejected condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till he raiſe mee up. Its true, that the <hi>captive exile HASTENETH</hi> that he may be looſed, and that he ſhould not die in the pit, as it is <hi>Eſay</hi> 51.14. But mark what is there ſaid, to ſuch a ſoule, haſtening for to bee taken out of the pit. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, who devided the Sea, whoſe waves roared, the Lord of Hoſts is his name. Jehovah</hi> is thy God, though thou art a captive exile in the pit. And thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to waite, to ſtand ſtill, and bee quiet, till God let thee ſee his ſalvation (as in the red Sea (for to that doth the Lord allude there,) Therefore, know your worke, and be wiſe to do it (O ye dejected ſouls!) you muſt waite and be contented in your waiting.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But <hi>muſt I be contented with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in which I want God.</hi> 'Twere ſomething to be contented with a <hi>comfortleſſe condition;</hi> but to be contented with a <hi>God-leſſe and Chriſt-leſſe condition,</hi> this is harſh, and I queſtion whither it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Firſt, you muſt diſtinguiſh, of <hi>a ſtate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God.</hi> There is a being <hi>without God ſo as men are by nature, i. e. Atheiſticall:</hi> And ſo I thinke that place ſhould bee tranſlated moſt clearly,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. proportionate unto that place of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. Now I doe not, dare not ſay (O dejected) <hi>Soul, thou ſhouldeſt be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſuch a condition.</hi> But there is a being without God, or <hi>Chriſt, ſo as ſouls are, who are in the darke,</hi> that want the viſibility of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: That indeed have his life, but are ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from <hi>his light,</hi> that ſee not God or Chriſt at all; who are not wholly ſtrangers to God, but to whom God ſeemes eſtranged, and from whom Chriſt ſeemes to be gone. And ſuch an eſtate thou muſt be contented in. But yet</p>
               <p>Secondly, You muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>content.</hi> There is a carnall, helliſh <hi>content (ariſing from a ſinfull frame of heart)</hi> ſuch as was in thoſe of whom <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes, that ſay to God, depart from us, that ſee no <hi>profit in his preſence,</hi> and that therefore can be well pleaſed with his <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> (as it is <hi>Job</hi> 21.) Thus 'twere helliſh to be contented. But there is a ſpiritual, holy <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment (ariſing from a ſubmiſſive frame of heart to Gods will,)</hi> ſuch as was in Chriſt, who ſubmitted to divine abſence. And in the Church, who ſaid, <hi>I will waite</hi> (that is, with content and patience) <hi>upon the Lord that hideth his face,</hi> Eſa. 8.17. And in this way thou oughteſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:120075:121"/>to want God and Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a ſweet ſubmiſſion to his will, That ſince hee'le not <hi>ſhine,</hi> thou muſt bee contented to bee in the <hi>darke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, It is one thing to bee content to want God and Chriſt <hi>for a time;</hi> it is another thing, to be contented to <hi>eternity.</hi> I will not ſay (as ſome do thinke) that <hi>we ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to want God to eternity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This is diſputable.</note> But its clear for a time we muſt be contented.</p>
               <p>Indeed I think we muſt, <hi>and we muſt not bee contented in our condition, when, and while we are dejected, for the want of God and Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. But alas! (thou wilt ſay) <hi>How ſhall I be thus. Its a myſtery to bee contented, and to bee not contented, and that at the ſame time, with reference to one and the ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed, tis true. <hi>This is a myſtery, but yet you muſt ſtudy it;</hi> And amongſt other helps, I ſhall mention three Conſiderations; which (if the ſpirit aſſiſt) will in a meaſure learn you this myſtery, of not being contented to want Chriſt; and yet of being contented to want him in your dejected condition, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Conſider, <hi>Chriſt is thy happines, but at his own diſpoſall.</hi> Becauſe he is thy <hi>happineſſe,</hi> thou muſt not content thy ſelfe without him: And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is at his owne diſpoſal, thou muſt be content a while to want him, and to waite for him. Mind it, O dejected ſoule; the Lord Jeſus is thy life, (thou muſt periſh without him) and therefore never be contented to want him. But withall remember he is thy Lord,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:120075:122"/>therefore if hee'le tarry, thou muſt be content to want, and to waite for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Conſider, <hi>Chriſt waited long for thee, but thou canſt not want him alwayes.</hi> Becauſe thou canſt not alwayes want Chriſt; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of being content to be without him; and yet becauſe he waited long for you, be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, if hee make you tarry a while for him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Conſider, <hi>If Chriſt never come to thee, thou art utterly undone: but if hee come at any time, thou art made for ever.</hi> Who can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to thinke of being utterly undone, and miſerable to all eternity? yet ſuch (O ſoul) thou wilt be, if Chriſt come not to thee at all. But if Chriſt come (though never ſo late) its not (too late) to make thee <hi>really, royally, everlaſtingly happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well mind this ſoule, and minding be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in theſe thoughts, then mayeſt thou come to bee acquainted with this <hi>myſtery of being contented to want God, Chriſt, comfort, &amp;c.</hi> and to wait even in thy ſaddeſt dejection with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of patience.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But <hi>What ſhall I ſay to ſilence Satan, and to ſtill my unquiet heart in Chriſts abſence,</hi> in during the time of my dejection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For that (O ſoul) take theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſupport thy ſpirit, and ſilence Satan in thy dejections.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Say to Satan and thy ſelfe, <hi>that Chriſt knows his owne time.</hi> Why ſhouldeſt thou ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>preſcribe,</hi> or <hi>confine</hi> him to time, what
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:120075:122"/>Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, that ſay you, to your dejected ſoules. His time is not yet come, though your time be alwayes, <hi>Job.</hi> 7.6. Tell thy ſoule, indeed Its time is alwayes, but Chriſts may not be yet. Say Chriſt is at his owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall, and he knowes his owne time. The wife that longs after her abſent Husband, ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth her ſelfe with this. My Husband knowes his owne time. Yea, and ſhe can with this alſo quiet the children too, who cry, oh that our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were come! Children, you Father knowes his own time. So O ſoul do thou ſilence thy ſelf, and do thou likewiſe anſwer thine enemy, who ſaith, <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> Say, my God, my Chriſt is in Heaven; and doth what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him. It pleaſeth him that I ſhould want, and waite, and I am contented for he knowes his own time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſts time, is the beſt time.</hi> His time is alwayes ſeaſonable. Tell thy ſoule, and Satan, thy time may not be fit, and ſeaſonable. Had a diſeaſed perſon, who lay by the Poole of <hi>Betheſda</hi> ſtept in to the water when he would, it had not beene well: And yet alwayes it was time for the diſeaſed. But it was not alway the <hi>ſpirits ſeaſon.</hi> The Text ſaith, <hi>An Angell went down at a certain ſeaſon,</hi> Joh. 5.4. O remember it dejected ſoule! Thy time is alwayes, but it is not ſeaſonable. Now Chriſts time is ever ſeaſonable, though not alwayes preſent. His time is the beſt time, the ſeaſonable time, the healing time.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdly, Say to thy ſoule, <hi>Though this time
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:120075:123"/>ſeeme long, yet tis certaine.</hi> Though it bee not now yet it will be. The viſion is for an appointed time <hi>i.e.</hi> for a ſeaſon) and though it tarry yet it will [SURELY] come, and <hi>not tarry.</hi> Chriſt will come in his owne time. Say to thy ſoule, though now thou want him. notwithſtanding thou ſhalt [YET] praiſe him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Tell thy ſoule, <hi>That Chriſts time is, when all hope is gone; and all meanes ſeemingly faile.</hi> When the ſoule is ſhut up, and there is nothing left; when hope, and meanes are gone, then is his time to come.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Tell your ſoules and Satan, <hi>That Chriſt is comming, while you are waiting.</hi> His Ship is under ſaile, while thou ſtandeſt looking upon the ſhoare. Hee is comming <hi>leaping and skipping over the Mountaines,</hi> while thou lyeſt <hi>ſighing</hi> in the <hi>vallies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Tell thy ſoule, and Satan, <hi>Chriſt comes ſecretly. When his Brethren were gone, then went hee up alſo to the Feaſt; not</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENLY, <hi>but as it were in</hi> SECRET, Joh. 7.10. Hee had told them, his time was not yet come. And now it is come, hee goes up <hi>in ſecret.</hi> Say, (O dejected ſoule!) I muſt want, and waite, and I am conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for Chriſts time is not yet come in ſight, and yet hee is, and may be comming in ſecret.</p>
               <p>So that now (to wind up this) know, your worke is to waite, and learne to bee content with your worke. Though thou
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:120075:123"/>art caſt downe, Yet bee not diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But bee patient, and ſtill waite in hope.</p>
               <p>Onely remember, that I do not by all this exclude either prayer, or endeavour. No, you muſt waite patiently, and want con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly: and yet you may pray and uſe meanes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>You may pray,</hi> Patience may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough conſiſt with prayer. Its a temptation to caſt off prayer in any dejection. <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> knew the time of the viſion was appointed, and therefore he would tarry and waite: But yet chap: 3: hee prayes: So may you, you may pray, and call (as the ſoules under the Altar) <hi>how long!</hi> You may expoſtulate with God, and intreate him to make haſt.</p>
               <p>Onely remember Two Cautions in your prayer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Remember, though you be importunate, yet be not impudent.</hi> When thou haſt prayed for haſt, lye at Gods feet if he tarry. Though thou tell God thou <hi>canſt not;</hi> yet doe not ſay, thou <hi>wilt not</hi> bear his hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Be ſubmiſſive,</hi> Say if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble come ſooner; But yet Lord not <hi>my will, but thy will bee done.</hi> Husband (writes the wife) if it be poſſible come quickly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a time; yet you are wiſe, I leave it to you. I reſt yours expecting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So write to Chriſt: O Lord if it bee poſſible come quickly; if it may become before I dye: However Lord, thou art wiſe, though I bee
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:120075:124"/>weake; not my time, but thy ſeaſon: I reſt, I remaine, thy patient, panting, waiting, Spouſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As you may pray, ſo you <hi>may indeavour in the uſe of meanes, to raiſe your ſelves,</hi> at leaſt to <hi>quiet your ſoules.</hi> Its deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate folly and faultineſſe, to caſt off the uſe of meanes, in any dejection. <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt up and be doing: And thou mayeſt work, and yet waite.</p>
               <p>Onely here take Two Cautions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe no unlawfull unappointed meanes.</hi> Though <hi>Soul</hi> may uſe <hi>Davids</hi> Harpe, yet he muſt not go to the Witch of <hi>End<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> to quiet his ſpirit. Though thou mayſt (and ſhouldeſt) Pray, Read, Heare, Confer, Communicate; yea, and Faſt (if with prudence:) Yet thou muſt not Drinke, Drab, Conjure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to quiet thy ſelfe. When Chriſt <hi>will not,</hi> thou <hi>ſhouldeſt not</hi> go to Satan to comfort thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In thy uſe of meanes, <hi>thou muſt not reſt in them.</hi> Thou muſt uſe all things as meanes, not as medicines. Its not the <hi>Word, Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> but Chriſt in them which thou muſt looke out for, as to cure. Though thou offer ſacrifice, yet thou <hi>muſt truſt in the Lord.</hi> Albeit, you may indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by workes, yet you muſt expect by faith. Beware of relying upon meanes for cure, or comfort. But in all, <hi>through all, looke out, and act faith upon Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, <hi>This I would
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:120075:124"/>if I might.</hi> I would beleeve, if I had ground.</p>
               <p>Why, <hi>Knew</hi> (O ſoule) <hi>in thy loweſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is ground for faith.</hi> When thou ſinkeſt deepeſt into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hine, and haſt no ground for thy feete, yet thou haſt ground for thy faith. <hi>David</hi> did, and thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and muſt act thy faith, and beleeve, even then, when thou art moſt <hi>caſt downe,</hi> and <hi>diſquieted.</hi> But of this I ſhall treate in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Section.</p>

               <p>Firſt, there are ſome really, i. e. rationally dejected; ſome ſoules are deeply dejected, and their grounds are weighty. Now this reall and certaine caſe of dejections is chiefly at foure times, or upon foure occaſions; as namely,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When a ſoule is deprived of all means of injoyment of God as formerly.</hi> Time was, it may be, that the ſoule lay in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the place where the Lord delighteth to dwell) and that hard by the Poole of <hi>Betheſda</hi> (wherein the Lord was wont to come downe.) Time was, when it ſate by the rivers head (even that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:120075:126"/>faire river that doth make glad the City of God) and where it could drink, when ere it was dry. Time was, when the ſoule ſate at the Lords Table (even <hi>the mount where the feaſt of ſai things is</hi>) and it could eate, when ere it was hungry, but now, it may be, it is otherwiſe with it; now happily its in the <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> in the <hi>barren land, where no water is;</hi> now its in the Deſert, where it hath neither <hi>Fountaine,</hi> nor <hi>Table;</hi> and a ſoule in ſuch a caſe is (and indeed cannot chuſe but be) ſad indeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Suppoſe the ſoule have its Wonted meanes, yet in caſe it wants his uſuall income in that meanes, in this caſe it is (and will be) much caſt downe.</hi> Happily the ſoule lyes by the Poole, but the Angel moves not; it ſits at the Table, but it eates nothing; it hath the Pipe, but though it ſuck hard it cannot draw a drop; its in the Galleries, but ſees not Chriſt there. The ſoule findes the breaſts dry, which were wont to ſuckle it; and though it have its former meanes, yet it miſſeth its former meales; it doth not ſee the glory as it was wont of old in the Temple: Now in this caſe it cannot but be caſt downe. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The ſoule is ſometimes in the darke, and ſees no light;</hi> it hath ſomething, but it is not ſatisfied, it hath loſt all its peace and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Sometimes the ſoule is (as <hi>Paul</hi> was) in a tempeſt of temptation, and ſees no light; neither Sunne, nor Moone, nor Starres, and that for many dayes together. Time was, it may be, when Chriſts candle ſhined upon his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:120075:127"/>head, and when by his light it walked through darknes; but alas now! now it may be, Chriſt is gone, and candle too. Now aſſurance is loſt, and evidence too; and the ſoul walks in the valley of darkneſſe, and doubtings: And in this caſe, its no wonder if it be dejected, and much caſt downe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>When the ſoule not only wants evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of love, but lyes under the appearance of wrath;</hi> then it muſt needs be caſt downe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, there was a time in which the ſoule was familiar with God, as a man is with his friend; and could ſee God ſmiling as its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but alas! now its not ſo, the ſoule cryes out, God hides his face, and holds it as his enemy. Surely now the ſoule wil be, and may be caſt downe.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſoules certainly dejected, who have certaine ground for their cryes in their caſtings down. But now there are others:</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Who are but conceited in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;</hi> that pretend, and ſay, they have ground, but indeed have none. <hi>Sion</hi> ſaid, <hi>God hath forſaken me;</hi> ſhe ſaid ſo, but God ſaid the contrary. Meere melancholly doth deject ſome, conceit is all the cauſe of their caſting downe; they deeme, or imagine cauſes, and thereupon are dejected.</p>
               <p>But now (Reader) if thy dejection be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or appearing; if thy caſting downe be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or in conceit; Be thy caſe what it wil be, or what thou thinkeſt it is; let it be as thou ſayeſt, that thou art caſt downe deeply,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:120075:127"/>yet this I ſay of thee, or of any in thy caſe, that thou and they, ought to act faith, and beleeve. For this is the predicate of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Now for this predicate or the thing that I do affirme of a ſoule thus caſt downe, take it in particulars thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Its their duty to beleeve.</hi> Dejected ſoules in caſe of failing to act faith, you ſinne. Some things in dejection, are rather wel if don, then faults if not done. Its rather good if done, then bad if not done. As joy, I cannot as yet ſee ſinne, in caſe of not rejoycing in deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (for no <hi>affliction is joyous for the preſent,</hi> (as it is <hi>Heb</hi> 12.11.) nay, <hi>tis grievous:</hi> Beſides, it contradicts dejection to rejoyce) But yet <hi>its ſinne if we doe not beleeve.</hi> I am not called to rejoycing in all caſes (for I muſt be ſenſible of, and ſo cannot but be ſorrowfull under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God) But I am called upon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve at all times, Faith is a ſtanding worke, and its duty to beleeve when I am dejected. Though I am not bound to rejoyce for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet I am bound to beleeve (as <hi>David</hi>) <hi>that yet I ſhall hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Its a Chriſtians glory to beleeve,</hi> when its caſt down, <hi>i.e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>'Tis a glory of theirs they may,</hi> All have not this <hi>priviledge,</hi> but ſome. Chriſtians its your glory, that you have a good ground for faith alwayes: you may beleeve in every caſe, of affliction, deſertion, dejection, caſting down, &amp;c. Yea and</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:120075:128"/>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>'Tis your glory if you can, and doe.</hi> To beleeve when all things faile, this is praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Its not ſo much glory to ſwimme with Bladders in a Calme Pond: But to ſwimme without Bladders in a Rough Sea: this is glory. And to act faith, when God lifts up, is not much (a child ſwimmes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when held up by the chinne.) But to beleeve when God caſts downe: This is a <hi>David</hi>-like faith, this argues a ſoule of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> i. e. ſtrong (as is hinted <hi>Zach:</hi> 12.8.)</p>
               <p>So that now you ſee the point explained. I ſhal now adde the ſecond thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Proofe.</hi> And I thinke (as I ſaid) if you weigh <hi>Davids</hi> caſe here, you wil ſee Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> caſe was certaine, and reall. He was now deprived of the meanes. Hee was now a ſtranger to his former holy-dayes.</p>
               <p>Hee now wants his income, he could not ſee that glory that he was wont.</p>
               <p>He now wants his peace and evidence, Alas! his God was gone, and he cryes out, God <hi>had forgotten him,</hi> ver. 9.</p>
               <p>Yea, hee now ſeemes to lye under wrath: he ſpeakes of the noyſe of the Almighties <hi>water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouts,</hi> and cryes out all his waves, and billowes went over him, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Now hee is dejected, and caſt downe for this. And yet now, even now, hee acts his faith, and beleeves, he ſhall <hi>praiſe God for all this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj: <hi>You will ſay, what is this to us?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:120075:128"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> 'Tis much, his caſe was bad as thine, O ſoule. And his example ought to bee thy rule.</p>
               <p>Queſt: <hi>Nay, but who can doe thus, as</hi> David <hi>did, can others imitate him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> Job went before him: Hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted in his deepe dejection, that if God added <hi>killing to all, yet he would truſt. Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Job 13.15.</p>
               <p>Adde to this of <hi>Job,</hi> that of the Church, <hi>Our bones are ſcattered at the graves mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sure ſoul, now they are low;</hi> their bones fly about as chips; they lye by the mouth of the grave, want nothing but tumbling in. And yet now (marke it) <hi>now mine eyes are unto thee O God my Lord, In thee doe I truſt,</hi> Pſal: 141.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Will you have a <hi>command</hi> for all this: See then that knowne Scripture, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 50. <hi>ult. Who is there among you</hi> (marke it whoever thou bee that feares God) <hi>who ſitteſt in the darke and ſees no light,</hi> (here is the loweſt caſe) <hi>let him truſt in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now you ſee both <hi>precept</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> holding out this, that even <hi>in the deepeſt dejection that we are or can thinke to be, we muſt act our faith and beleeve.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the faith which muſt be acted: I deſcribe that thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a reſolute, and noble exerciſe, of the grace of faith, in which the ſoule quiets it ſelf in, and reſts it ſelfe upon God, and Chriſt; expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and looking for an accompliſhment of all the promiſes, as to joy, or holineſſe; notwithſtanding all the feares, and all the doubts which may ariſe to the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This faith ſuppoſeth <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>feares,</hi> but <hi>it over-comes</hi> them, It ſeeth <hi>hinderances,</hi> but <hi>it triumphs</hi> over them. It feeles <hi>diſquietings</hi> but <hi>it ſuppreſſeth</hi> them: And whatever the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be, whether for <hi>life, joy, peace, comforts, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. it expects a fulfilling</hi> of it from God, and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, To ſee this clearer, I ſhall
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:120075:129"/>inſtance in the particulars of this faith, and this I ſhall do

               <p>Generally, <hi>In our deepeſt dejections wee are to hold faſt cur former faith in any particular.</hi> We muſt beleeve all that which ever we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and know, concerning <hi>God, Chriſt, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp;c. Some are apt in dejection, to bring all things into queſtion: To queſtion God, Chriſt, and all: But now remember, <hi>whatever thou didſt know and beleeve of God and Chriſt, or his wayes, out of the Scripture before, thou muſt beleeve the ſame ſtill.</hi> Let not Satan draw thee into a doubt, much leſſe a deniall of former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and profeſſed truths. They are all as true now, as ever. A man who ſees houſes and trees in the day time: doth beleeve that the ſame houſes, and trees, &amp;c. are even in the night, when he is in the darke, and cannot ſee them. And Saints muſt beleeve all that in the night of dejection, which they ſaw, and beleeved, in the day of converſion. But</p>
               <p>Particularly, Soules in their deepeſt dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>ought</hi> (even in order to their releife and raiſing) <hi>to beleeve</hi> theſe three things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The power of God,</hi> i.e. They ought to beleeve that the Lords <hi>hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave;</hi> but he is Almighty, and all-ſufficient ſtill. It was the ſinne of unbeleeving
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:120075:130"/>
                  <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that they queſtioned the Almighties power: CAN GOD (ſay they) <hi>prepare a table in the Wilderneſſe? Behold, he ſmote the rocke, that waters guſhed out, and the ſtreames over-flowed:</hi> CAN <hi>he give bread alſo?</hi> CAN <hi>hee provide fleſh for his people?</hi> Pſal. 78.20. Soules under dejection; you are apt to diſpair even of divine power; you are ready to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion Gods <hi>Can.</hi> But you ſhould not, you ſhould alway beleeve and ſay as he did, <hi>Lord if thou Wilt, thou Canſt, &amp;c.</hi> Its a choyce paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to this purpoſe, which you have, Joh: 11.22. Where <hi>Martha,</hi> even when her Brother was dead, beleeves Chriſts power, <hi>I know that EVEN NOW, whatſoever thou wilt aske of God, God will give it.</hi> Marke, ſhe beleeved, even then, when her Brother was dead. Mind it, O yee dejected ſoules, in your loweſt ſtate, you muſt beleeve Chriſt can helpe and raiſe. Yea</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>You muſt beleeve this poſſibility with reference to your ſelves.</hi> Do not ſay, Chriſt can cure this in another; but beleeve he can do it to thee. The Leper ſaid, <hi>thou canſt make</hi> MEE <hi>whole,</hi> Matth: 8.2. As in the point of reſurrection of the body, its not enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the reſurrection of a body, but of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of thine. (So <hi>Job</hi> beleeved with his fleſh, and his eyes, and not anothers ſhould ariſe, chap: 19.27.) In like manner, here in the point, of raiſing from dejection, the ſoule muſt act faith in, or for himſelfe. He muſt beleeve that Chriſt can raiſe him, (even) him,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:120075:130"/>how low, or deep ſoever he be caſt down. Adde to this</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the ſoule is gone thus farre, as to beleeve a poſſibility; it muſt goe farther in beleeving, <hi>an inclinableneſſe at leaſt in God, or Christ to do as they can.</hi> As the ſoul is to act faith for a poſſibility, that Chriſt can; ſo it is to act faith for a probability that he wil. The ſoul muſt not ſay, that Chriſt hath forgotten to be kind; or that his mercies are cleane gone: No, it muſt beleeve, that there are ſome thoughts of it ſtill: and that yet there is a mercy in ſtore. Mind <hi>David</hi> in Pſalm. 40 <hi>ult. I am poor and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> what then? ſee what followes; <hi>yet the Lord thinketh on me.</hi> Surely, (O ſad ſoule) thou muſt not ſay (as <hi>Zion</hi> did) <hi>my God hath forgotten me, i.e.</hi> altogether caſt thee off: No, thou muſt beleeve, that yet he thinketh (at leaſt) of thee. His heart retaines ſome love, and yet there is ſome inclination in him, to raiſe and help thee.</p>
               <p>But now to come higher, if the ſoule bee come up here, to beleeve theſe particulars, it muſt goe further, to beleeve ſome Specialls. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is not enough to retaine faith in fundamentalls, and to beleeve a power in Chriſt, (though as to our ſelves) and an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſſe to raiſe: But in our dejections, we <hi>muſt act faith, that yet Chriſt certainly will help, and raiſe us. David</hi> ſaith, hee ſhall yet praiſe God as health, <hi>i. e.</hi> as his healer. <hi>After two dayes he</hi> [WILL] <hi>revive us, and the third day
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:120075:131"/>he</hi> [WILL] <hi>raiſe us up, and we</hi> [SHALL] <hi>live in his ſight,</hi> Hoſ. 6.2. Mind it, the Church beleeves it certaine (though ſhe leave God to his time) he <hi>will,</hi> and wee <hi>ſhall.</hi> Dejected hearts, you muſt beleeve Chriſt will raiſe you: Though you bee downe, yet <hi>you ſhall ariſe</hi> (as it is <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8.) here then is the firſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſtep you muſt aſcend, in the acting of faith, you muſt beleeve you ſhall bee hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Breath O ſoule upon this ſtair, for you muſt go higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, You muſt beleeve, <hi>That even in your dejections you are not deſerted.</hi> It was <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, though <hi>Iſrael</hi> were low, yet God had not caſt them off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. Dejected heart, Chriſt is with thee in thy dejections, he hath not left thee, though thou be low? <hi>Iſrael hath not been forſaken, nor Judah of his God,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 51.5. you muſt beleeve Chriſt is with you though you are not aware of it: <hi>David</hi> did thus, <hi>nevertheleſſe I am continually with thee, thou haſt holden me by my right hand,</hi> Pſal. 73.23. Though <hi>Davids</hi> foote did ſlip, yet God was with him, So Chriſt is with thee, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſguiſe of thy dejection, (O caſt downe ſoule) and thou muſt beleeve this, even in thy deepeſt dejections. Further,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>You muſt beleive that you ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all your doubtings to the contrary, as your fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Thou art apt to queſtion Power, and to doubt Will; Thou art ready to ſay, I am cut off, and caſt out, and I ſhall go all my dayes in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:120075:131"/>bitterneſſe, &amp;c. well, when thy ſorrow hath thus vented it ſelfe, thou muſt beleeve its thy ſinne, and that one day thou ſhalt with ſhame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it. <hi>I ſaid in mine haſt I am cut off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes. David</hi> ſaid ſo, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it was in his haſt, Pſalm. 31.22. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> did the like, after he had vented himſelfe ſadly; <hi>will the Lord caſt off for ever? hath he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be gracious? &amp;c. And I ſaid</hi> (pray mind it) <hi>this is my infirmity. Pſ.</hi> 77.10. He ſaid this and that, but he confeſſed what he ſaid, was in his weakneſſe.</p>

               <p>It may be (O ſoule) thou ſayeſt this is high: True, Yet your faith muſt aſcend higher. For</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>You ſhould act your faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you ſhall yet ſee God, as your God.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51. to truſt upon God as ours; <hi>let him truſt upon</hi> [his] <hi>God:</hi> This is more, its more to beleeve an <hi>intereſt in God, then helpe from God,</hi> yet this thou muſt beleeve (O ſad ſoule!) <hi>David</hi> ſaith here, that he ſhal <hi>yet praiſe him</hi> (marke his phraſe, and ſaith) I <hi>my God;</hi> not only, <hi>as the health of my countenance</hi> i. e. as my healer, and raiſer, &amp;c. but, <hi>as my God.</hi> You muſt beleeve in your loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:120075:132"/>God is ſtill yours, though thy condition be low, yet thy intereſt is not loſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>You muſt beleeve that a ſinging time is comming, notwithſtanding preſent caſting downe:</hi> You muſt remember <hi>your Songs of old,</hi> and beleeve you ſhall yet ſing them againe. <hi>I ſhall yet praiſe him</hi> (ſaith our text) though now thou <hi>ſigh,</hi> yet thou ſhalt <hi>ſing;</hi> your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall be turned into joy; you now ſit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate, and your <hi>Harp</hi> is now hung by the <hi>Willowes;</hi> your <hi>ſtrings</hi> are now <hi>broke,</hi> and your ſpirit is now heavy, but yet you muſt beleeve joy ſhall returne, and that one day you ſhall take your <hi>Harp,</hi> and <hi>tune</hi> it againe, and ſing your <hi>old</hi> (yea and a <hi>new</hi>) ſong upon your <hi>chiefeſt Inſtruments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>You muſt beleeve that this ſhall be ſo eminent, that Sathan ſhall ſee it, and be aſhamed;</hi> now Sathan triumphs in thy ſadneſſe, and ſaith, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> You muſt beleeve that your God is ſtill preſent, and that ere long he wil ſo appeare, as that Sathan ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of what he hath ſaid againſt thy God, and thee; thus the Church ſaith, <hi>Micha</hi> 7.10. <hi>Then ſhe that is mine enemy ſhall ſee it, and ſhame ſhall cover her which ſaid unto me, Where is the Lord thy God?</hi> There is a day a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in which thou ſhalt ſay, <hi>Loe, this is my God, I have waited for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put all theſe things together, and they make up ſuch a <hi>crede</hi> as this, which thou (O ſoule) mayeſt ſay in thy deepeſt dejections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I beleeve ſtill all that I did of my God, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:120075:132"/>Chriſt, of the Scriptures, and holineſſe; and I yet beleeve that there is a power in God that he can help, and that not only in others caſes, but in my owne; yea, and I beleeve that he is inclinable and willing: Nay, I beleeve certainly the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of my dejected heart, and Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence even in this dejection; yea, I beleeve I ſhall one day confeſſe my preſent feares to be my failings, when I ſhall ſee God, and Chriſt againe as mine, and when I ſhall ſing a new ſong of praiſe, and ſalvation, even in the ſight of, and to the ſhame of Sathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, O ſoule, thou muſt beleeve even in thy deepeſt dejection, when thou art caſt downe loweſt, and ſeeſt God leaſt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 4.</head>
               <head type="sub">The grounds and reaſons of this Doctrine, and duty of thus beleeving in dejections.</head>
               <p>YOu have now ſeene the explication of the duty wherein it lyes, you ſhall now ſee the reaſons thereof, viz. why a dejected ſoule ſhould act his faith even at the loweſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe its the nature of faith thus to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe;</hi> Faith doth ſuppoſe ſtraights, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and yet over-comes them all. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that hope that is ſeene is not hope,</hi> Rom. 8, 24. i. e. Its in the very nature of hope to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an inviſibility of its object, <hi>for what a man
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:120075:133"/>ſeeth why doth he yet hope for,</hi> as tis there: In like manner, faith, in that which is viſible is not faith. You finde in Scripture this definition of faith, <hi>That it is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Heb. 11.1. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, faith (as hope) ſuppoſeth its object not ſeene, or not in ſight; and yet when the thing is not ſeene, then it ſubſtantiates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alizeth the things as if they were. Dejected ſoules! you ſay you are caſt low, your pit is very darke, and you ſee nothing; now you muſt beleeve, for its the nature of faith to evidence, and cleare up, and cleave to things in the darke: Now thou ſeeſt nothing, now thou ſhouldeſt beleeve, <hi>and in thy faith ſee all things,</hi> and conclude of them as certaine. Though thou be caſt downe, yet thou muſt ſee raiſing up, and beleeve it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To beleeve in your deep dejections cleares the ſtrength of</hi> faith; <hi>Thomas</hi> his faith was weake, when he would <hi>not beleeve except</hi> he ſaw: <hi>Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nailes, &amp;c. I will not beleeve,</hi> Joh 20.25. Soule! thy faith is weake, if thou ſay, Ile not beleeve becauſe I ſee nothing. <hi>Bleſſed are they which have not ſeene</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and yet have beleeved.</hi> It were a bleſſed ſigne that thy faith is ſtrong, couldeſt thou beleeve now thou art loweſt, and ſeeſt God leaſt; it is an eaſie thing to ſwim with Bladders, but it argues skil and ſtrength to ſwim without. It argued the Diſciples faith to be but ſmall, that in the great ſtorme they could not beleeve; and now
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:120075:133"/>thou art dejected it wil argue but weake faith, if now thou wilt not beleeve. As he who faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>the day of adverſity,</hi> gives notice his ſtrength is but weake; ſo he who <hi>doubteth in the day of dejection,</hi> declares his faith is not ſtrong: Now it ſhould be your wiſdome to witneſſe the ſtrength of your faith, by your beleeving when you are loweſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt is pleaſed to take this way of bringing the ſoule low, when he intends to lift it high.</hi> Your dejection is Chriſts way to bring you to exaltation. Why ſhould not I beleeve a thing when I am in the way to it? If I am in the way to glory, and life; and immortality, and peace, and joy, and healing, &amp;c. I ſay, if I am in the way to theſe things, why ſhould I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them? Why (ſoul) <hi>the way of lifting up is caſting downe, and now you are in the way you ought to</hi> beleeve; <hi>Joſephs</hi> Dungeon was Gods way to his ſetting him ſecond in <hi>Aegypt; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> flight, and feare before <hi>Saul,</hi> was Gods way to bring him to the Throne: When <hi>David</hi> was in his greateſt feare (that he ſaid he ſhould dye by the hands of <hi>Saul</hi>) then was he within few ſteps of the Throne; and when thou art moſt caſt downe, ready to dye in the pit, then is Chriſt neareſt to pull thee out; and ſurely (O ſoule) <hi>the nearer Chriſt is to deliver thee out of, the ſtronger ſhould thy faith be in dejections.</hi> You now ſee reaſons for the point, its not ſo irrationall as unbeleef makes it, to act faith when we are moſt dejected.</p>

               <head type="sub">One improvement of this Doctrine to informe the judgement.</head>
               <p>YOu heare now, that times of dejection are to be <hi>times of faith,</hi> when the ſoule is loweſt it is to beleeve. Pray be informed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to know <hi>when faith is ſeaſonable;</hi> you may miſtake much, if you thinke that dejection is, or may be a time for doubting: No, it is the <hi>ſeaſon of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſoules thinke, that if the promiſe be cleare, if experience be rich, if hints are many, and taſte is ſweet, O now ſurely they are to beleeve; <hi>now is a time of faith.</hi> It is true, now is a time for faith to lay in, and ſtore up. But ſuppoſe the <hi>Promiſe is darke, experience poore, hints none, taſte dry,</hi> &amp;c. ſuppoſe all is darke, and there appeares nothing; know that this is a time for faith to come, and lay forth it ſelfe, for the ſoules ſettlement; you miſtake the matter (O ſoule) if you thinke times of dejection to be times only for patience; no, they are times alſo for faith: Yea, and in caſe you beleeve not, you wil not (indeed cannot) be patient. Suppoſe thou art very low, and cryeſt loud, and God anſwereth not; ſuppoſe Conſcience accuſeth, Sathan triumphs, and Chriſt appeare not; ſuppoſe it darke, that the Sunne ſhine not, and there be no Starre. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou looke on the <hi>left hand,</hi> where Chriſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:120075:134"/>workes <hi>(for caſting downe is a left-hand work)</hi> but thou canſt not behold him; yea, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (O ſoule) he hideth himſelfe on the right hand, that thou canſt not ſee him. Is thy caſe thus, as <hi>Jobs</hi> was (chap. 23.9.) know now it is a time not only to exerciſe <hi>Jobs</hi> patience (in bearing) but to act <hi>Jobs</hi> faith, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
               <p>Every Grace (O ſoule) hath its ſeaſon, and Faith is in its ſeaſon in a dejected ſtate; yea Chriſt expects it from us, that we beleeve in him then when our hearts are moſt diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The hearts of his Diſciples were troubled, (caſt downe) and dejected, and yet he bids them beleeve, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.1.</p>
               <p>Whom having not ſeen ye love, <hi>though now you ſee him not,</hi> yet <hi>ye beleeve,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> (1 Epiſt. chap. 1. verſ. 8.) It is Chriſts time to be not only <hi>loved by you,</hi> but truſted upon, and <hi>beleeved in</hi> when you ſee him not. And in order unto the triall of this it is, that ſometime Chriſt ſees it needfull (as it is there, ver. 6.) to let you be in heavineſſe <hi>through manifold temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;</hi> I beſeech you now improve this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to informe your judgements in the time of faith, Chriſt (O ſoule) wil bring thee low ere he doe raiſe thee up, and while thou art low, he expects to ſee thee raiſing thy ſelfe by faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why doth Chriſt thus? why doth he caſt downe his poore creature, ere he lift it up? why takes he this courſe to exerciſe my faith?</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:120075:135"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I. <hi>Its thy duty</hi> (O ſoule) <hi>rather to doe, then diſpute;</hi> rather ſtrive to beleeve, then to queſtion his dealing. But yet,</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Know O ſoule, Chriſt hath more ends then one in caſting thee downe, and making that his way for his comfort, and thy faith;</hi> he hath more then one ground for this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby Chriſt cleares his grace to thy ſoule;</hi> he brings thee low, and ſhuts thee up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unbeleefe, that he might make thee ſee his raiſing is meere mercy, as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. If Chriſt let thee be ready to doubt, and dye ere he raiſe thee, thou wilt ſee it was free grace only which moved him to helpe thee; now that thou maiſt ſee this, he lets thee be moſt caſt downe ere he come to exalt thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>By this Chriſt helps thy taſte, to reliſh mercy in its full ſweetneſſe.</hi> To be ready to ſtarve with hunger, and dye of thirſt, and then to have bread and drinke; this makes it reliſh the ſweetneſſe of both. That Chriſt may cauſe thee to <hi>taſt his love</hi> (in thy raiſing) the ſweeter, he uſes to let thee lye low, and be much caſt downe, ere he come, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt hath a deſigne upon his owne glory, in thy deep dejection:</hi> He not only lookes to evidence the <hi>ſtrength of thy faith,</hi> but the <hi>brightneſſe of his owne glory,</hi> by making thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſinke in dejections ere he raiſe thee; it wil argue <hi>glorious power,</hi> and <hi>deep wiſdome,</hi> to raiſe a ſoule loſt in its ſelfe: So that now, O ſoule, if thou canſt but beleeve, <hi>thou ſhalt ſee the glory of Chriſt,</hi> as it is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.40. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:120075:135"/>then doe not ſtand queſtioning, why doth Chriſt bring thee low, and make that a time of faith. But up, and act; ſay, <hi>Indeed I am caſt downe, and diſquieted, I am in the darke, and ſee no light, I am low, and know not how to raiſe my ſelfe, yet now Ile beleeve, for this my dejection is to be a time of beleeving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verily thou art a God <hi>that hideſt thy ſelfe, O God of Iſrael, the Saviour,</hi> Iſa. 45.15. God was hid, yea he hid himſelfe; yet marke it, now the Church acteth her faith, <hi>Iſrael ſhall be ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation,</hi> ver. 17.</p>
               <p>See (O ſoule) God hid himſelfe, <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſee his Saviour, nor the way of his ſalvation (for both were hid) yet even now faith ſaith, <hi>Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, here is the firſt improvement of this Doctrine, let it <hi>reforme a miſtake, and informe the judgement in this truth, that times of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are not only times of patience, but they are times of faith.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider that this faith is that which Chriſt eminently pronounceth bleſſed;</hi> To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve then when the ſoule is dejected, and in the darke, and ſees not, is a bleſſed thing, and argues a very bleſſed frame of Spirit; Jeſus (ſaid unto <hi>Thomas</hi>) <hi>Becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt beleeved, bleſſed are they who have not ſeen, and YET beleeved,</hi> Joh. 20.29. I doe not doubt, but that <hi>Thomas</hi> was truly bleſſed, though he ſaid, he would not (and as it ſeems, he did not) <hi>beleeve before he ſaw;</hi> but yet Chriſt declares him, or ſhe, to be eminently bleſſed, <hi>that beleeve and ſee not.</hi> Minde it ye (ſad ſoules) who cry out, you are dejected low, and ſee nothing; if now you can beleeve, you are in a bleſſed ſtate, yea you are eminently bleſſed, how ever deeply dejected, if you can but now act your faith. Thy low ſtate is not ſad, but bleſſed (O beleeving ſoule) <hi>He that beleeves hath a witneſſe in himſelf</hi> (&amp; by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt, inabled to conclude) that he is bleſſed. Wouldeſt thou (O ſoule) be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? yea even in thy dejected ſtate, wouldeſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:120075:137"/>have a ground <hi>(of Chriſts allowance, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)</hi> to ſay thou art not miſerable though caſt downe: why then beleeve.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Beleeving in a ſtate of darkneſſe, and dejection, gives glory to God.</hi> God is not glorified by the faith of any, ſo much as by the faith of the dejected: When <hi>Abraham</hi> was (as it were) dead (and ſo paſt children) then his beleeving was a glorious faith; <hi>He was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4.20. Thou ſayeſt (O dejected ſoule) <hi>let God have glory what ere become of thee;</hi> Why here is the way to give God glory, act thy faith upon his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power,</hi> his <hi>gracious promiſe,</hi> his <hi>good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,</hi> &amp;c. even now in thy low ſtate, ſo ſhalt thou glorifie him indeed. Though thou be weake, yet beleeve his ſtrength; though thou be unworthy, yet beleeve his grace; though thou art very low, and ſee very little, yet now beleeve, <hi>and account him faithfull, able, ready, willing to raiſe, help, releeve, and comfort;</hi> thus thou ſhalt give him glory indeed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Beleeving now will ingage God to help;</hi> God, and Chriſt account it an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to help, in caſe the ſoule beleeve; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye when at loweſt. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> Iſa. 26.3. Mark it, <hi>becauſe the Lord truſteth,</hi> therefore Chriſt wil keep. Its true, there is <hi>no merit in faith,</hi> but yet the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy counts it an <hi>ingagement</hi> to helpe: Some have urged this, why they <hi>muſt goe,</hi> and <hi>needs doe</hi> ſuch or ſuch a thing, becauſe a poore
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:120075:137"/>man relyes upon them, and truſts to them, and muſt and will be undone if they faile him: Why, will a man upon that account help, and will not Chriſt much more? O! will Chriſt ſay of a ſoule that is ready to ſinke, and yet relyes on him, and truſts to him. <hi>Here is a poore ſoule that depends on me, and I ſee muſt periſh if I faile him; O ſurely ile not ſuffer him to faile.</hi> They that truſt in the Lord ſhall never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, the Lord will not be <hi>as waters that doe faile,</hi> as it is, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15.18. <hi>My fleſh faileth</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>but God is the rock of my health, Pſal.</hi> 73. Dejected ſoules! would you ingage Chriſt to raiſe you? then beleeve, though you are caſt downe never ſo low.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Even very beleeving is our riſing when we are caſt down;</hi> The ſoule that beleeves doth riſe, and when Chriſt drawes up our faith, he doth raiſe us up from our dejected ſtate. It is with the beleeving ſoule in his pit of dejection, as with <hi>Peter</hi> in his Priſon; it is ſaid, the Angel of the Lord ſmote <hi>Peter</hi> on the ſide, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe;</hi> why you know <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>bound with two chaines,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> might have ſaid thus; I am bound, how can I riſe and goe out? no, <hi>Peter</hi> doth not object, but beleeves: <hi>He ariſeth, and his chains fall off from his hands;</hi> marke it, his beleeving doth unbinde him: <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith the Angel, <hi>follow me; Peter</hi> might have ſaid, The doore is ſhut, there is a firſt and ſecond ward, beſides that, there is an Iron Gate faſt bard, and there are Keepers that keepe the doore: No, <hi>Peter</hi> reaſons not thus,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:120075:138"/>But he beleeves, and goes; <hi>and the doores open of themſelves, the very Iron Gate of its owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord gives way,</hi> and the Keepers are kept under ſleep from oppoſing. See, <hi>Peters</hi> faith doth all, it opens the doores, and brings him forth, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. So (O ſoule) doe thou beleeve, <hi>Ariſe</hi> (O dejected ſoule) doe not ſay, <hi>I am bound with chaines of difficulties, and bolted up under doores of doubtings;</hi> but up, beleeve, thy very belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is (at leaſt) thy riſing poſture, and thy doore-opening hand. O doe not ſtand object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reaſoning, or queſtioning, but beleeve, as hath been opened.</p>
               <p>Peradventure by this thy ſoule is made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtirre, and now thou only deſireſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to help thee, and for that take theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>

               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:120075:138"/>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Beware of concluding any thing from preſent ſence;</hi> Sence is an oppoſite to reaſon ſometimes, but to faith it is an enemy alwaies; hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> did, and we ſhould, walk not by ſence, but by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 At preſent (O ſoule) thou ſayeſt, <hi>Thou ſeeſt nothing but wrath, thou feeleſt nothing but ſorrow, thou heareſt nothing but threatning, &amp;c.</hi> take heed thou conclude not thy ſtate by thy ſence: <hi>A ſtate ſenſibly bad, may be really good, as a ſtate ſeemingly good, may be ſubſtantially bad.</hi> As the ſeared Conſciences of Reprobates, ſo the ſcrupulous Conſciences of Saints are not fit, nor able to make right concluſions. What though (at preſent) Sence preſent nothing ſo much as in order to a cure, yet cured thou ſhalt be; <hi>God creates light out of darkneſſe, and ſhines into our hearts to give us the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelfe in the face of Chriſt,</hi> as it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. Though at preſent thou art ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of nothing but <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> yet God may create a <hi>light</hi> out of that. Beware of concluding any thing from preſent ſence or feeling.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Beware of eying it tso much;</hi> looke off from what thou ſeeſt, and art ſenſible of, unto that thou ſeeſt not; <hi>We faint not</hi> (ſaid the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) Why? marke it: <hi>We looke not at the things Which we ſee, but at the things which we ſee not,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16.18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider not ſelfe;</hi> Selfe is alwaies inſufficient as to holy worke, or joy; If thou conclude from the conſideration of <hi>ſelfe,</hi> thy concluſion wil be falſe. Thou art caſt downe,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:120075:139"/>and Childe-like art nor able to riſe againe, Selfe cannot raiſe thy ſoule; what then, wilt thou conclude thy ſoule cannot be raiſed? O take heed of this, <hi>Where ſelfe is inſufficient, Chriſt is ſufficient;</hi> and when we are weake, his power is magnified in our weakneſſe. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> conſidered not his owne body now dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. had <hi>Abraham</hi> conſidered himſelf, he had never beleeved for a Sonne; it was <hi>Sarahs</hi> fault (and the ground of her laughing unbeleefe) <hi>ſhe conſidered her ſelfe as old,</hi> &amp;c. you muſt not therefore conſider ſelfe as weake; no, let me adde this; you <hi>must not conſider ſelfe as ſinfull:</hi> This may hinder faith. As weakneſſe to helpe our ſelves, ſo unworthineſſe to be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by Chriſt, is generally the cauſe of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unbeleefe; but take heed of both, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> beleeved though himſelfe was old, yea and though <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed, neither his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor her ſinne could hinder his faith. Take heed therefore of eying ſelfe, either as unable, or unworthy: Chriſt is able to raiſe the weak, yea and willing to lift up the worthleſſe ſoules of caſt-down ones.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Conclude nothing by Satan,</hi> Hee'l tell you <hi>of difficulties,</hi> and impoſſibilities, but conſider him not. As Satan makes the proud heart of exalted Babilon think it ſhal never fal, ſo he would make the grieved heart of dejected Sion think it ſhall never riſe, but know, Satan is a Lyar, and who would beleeve an old conſtant Lyar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee'l ſay, <hi>deſpaire,</hi> when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>hope:</hi> But beleeve thou the Lord Jeſus, and ſlight
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:120075:139"/>Satan, be ſure to conclude nothing from his ſuggeſtions.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But what if Conſcience joyne with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</hi> what if that witneſſe to Satans words, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Beleeve not, nor conclude from thy owne Conſcience,</hi> it is poſſible that may erre; and looke as the ſeared Conſcience of the wicked erre, and ſpeake peace when there is no ground; ſo the <hi>ſeduced Conſcience</hi> of the godly may create trouble when there is no cauſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>Chriſt ſometimes doth permit Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to condemne, to heighten his owne grace in acquitting.</hi> It is ſometimes in Spirituals, as it is in Temporals, <hi>we receive the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we may not truſt in our ſelves.</hi> Doe not therefore (O dejected ſoule) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of thy caſt-down condition from Satans ſuggeſtions, no not when backt with thy owne Conſcience; care not for Satans condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nay, <hi>judge not thine owne ſelfe,</hi> as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Beware of concluding any thing form preſent ſeeming rejections of Chriſt,</hi> Many a caſt downe ſoule cryes; O Chriſt ſeemes to reject mee, and therefore I am loſt, and ther's no hope, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But mind it (O ſoule) as a Caution, <hi>Though Chriſt at preſent ſeem to reject thee, yet conclude nothing.</hi> Thou knoweſt (and oh that thou wouldeſt for this purpoſe conſider well the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan.</hi>) Chriſt at firſt did ſeeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject her. I <hi>am not ſent</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>but to the loſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:120075:140"/>ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Nay, he calls her <hi>dog,</hi> and upon that account denyes her childrens bread: yet you know the iſſue, Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of concluding from the preſent dealings of Chriſt: though he ſeem to reject thee (and let thee lie.) Though he ſpeak as if he meant not to cure thee, and call thee dog (as if he would not have to doe with thee) yet beleeve, for all this may be but a ſhew to try thee, and thy faith. Its ſaid in the ſtory of the journey of Chriſts Diſciples from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Emaus;</hi> that Chriſt made as though he would have gone further, yet upon entreaty, he went in to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.28, 29. Chriſt (O ſoul) may ſeem to goe away, when he intends to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Only he lookes for intreaty. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not conclude any thing from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent viſible ſeeming rejections of Chriſt. He may frowne, and ſmite, caſt off, and reject, cal thee dog, and deny thee a crum: and yet he may intend (and if thou beleeve and waite, will) to imbrace thee, and raiſe thee up, and to fill thy ſoule with healing and rejoycing.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe things by way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be taken heed of. I ſhall now adde one or two <hi>poſitive conſiderations,</hi> for the inabling of the ſoule, to act his faith even then when it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth loweſt, and ſeeth leaſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider there can be no juſt ground why thou ſhouldeſt not beleeve.</hi> As formerly I ſaid, there can be no juſt ground for our great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing caſting downe: ſo now I ſay, there can be no juſt ground why we ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:120075:140"/>that yet <hi>we ſhall praiſe God.</hi> Tis true, the ſoule is apt to conceive grounds of diſpaire; at leaſt to conclude there are grounds why it ſhould not beleeve. But mind it wel, and you ſhal ſee, there is no reaſon can be given, why the ſoule though never ſo low, and caſt downe, ſhould not beleeve its raiſing up by Chriſt, and its rejoycing in Chriſt. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>There is no command or inhibition to the contrary.</hi> 'Tis true, Satan ſayes there is an inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, but he is a falſe Prophet, and God never ſent him. The dejected ſoule cryes out, O I may not, I muſt not, I dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
               <p>Why (O ſoule) why muſt not you beleeve? who ſaid ſo? when did Chriſt forbid thee? where is the word that faith, you may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. Nay, is not the Scripture expreſſe in commanding you to beleeve at all times. Is not this his commandement that we ſhould <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. See, the Text is poſitive, why ſhouldeſt thou ſay then, that thou mayeſt not beleeve.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The depth of your dejection, neither is,</hi> (nor ought to be) <hi>a ground why you ſhould not beleeve.</hi> Others have been as low as you, and yet God hath raiſed them. <hi>Joh, Aſaph, Heman, Hezekiah, &amp;c.</hi> were much caſt down, yet they were raiſed. One of them cryes out, I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, <hi>and ready to dye,</hi> Pſal. 88.15. Another cryes out, his <hi>ſpirit was overwhelmed,</hi> Pſal. 77.3. A third cryes out, <hi>I ſhall never more ſee the Lord in the land of the living, ,</hi> Eſai. 38.11. Thus
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:120075:141"/>theſe ſoules cryed out of their depths: and yet were raiſed, Be as low as thou doeſt, or canſt imagine, yet thy deepeſt dejection can be no ground, why thou ſhouldeſt not beleeve. Nay, hath not the Lord ſaid that he regards the low eſtate of his ſervants. And did not <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>out of the deep I cryed, and he heard me; And he brought me up alſo out of the horrible pit,</hi> as it is, Pſal. 40.2. Suppoſe thy pit be very horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet out of that thou mayeſt bee brought up:</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thy defilement can be no ground why thou ſhouldeſt not beleeve,</hi> Its not thy dirtineſſe (O dejected ſoule) that ſhould increaſe thy doubt, or hinder thy faith. Chriſt raiſes the ſoul from the dunghill. Yea, he takes it up when it lyes in the Kennel. <hi>Iſrael hath not been forſaken, not Judah of his God</hi> [THOUGH] <hi>their land were</hi> [FILLED] <hi>with ſin againſt the Holy one of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Jer: 51: 5. Marke it, though they were filled with ſin, yet they were not really (whatever they thought) forſaken of their God. That Jeſus, who dyed for you, when you were <hi>dead in ſin;</hi> wil raiſe thee, though thou be defiled with ſin. Suppoſe your ſoule, as vile a ſinner (as Satan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents you) yet remember, Chriſt dyed for ſinners, for ungodly, for enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8, 10. So that thy defilement is no juſt ground why thou ſhouldeſt not beleeve.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Thy former and preſent doubtings, and unbeleefe, can be no juſt ground, why you may not beleeve.</hi> Admit thou haſt doubted long yet thou mayeſt beleeve at laſt,</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:120075:141"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But What will not, doth not my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe cut me off from the Promiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, paſt unbeleefe is no juſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to faith now, <hi>Davids</hi> former doubting did not hinder his injoyment of the Promiſe; It is true, he ſaid in <hi>his</hi> haſt (as you doe) <hi>He was quite caſt out.</hi> And, that <hi>all men were Lyars;</hi> he meant the Prophets, who told him of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and yet God ſetled him, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his unbeleefe. Thy unbeleefe ſhall not make voyd Gods faithfulneſſe; doe not ſay, I have doubted ſo long, that it is in vaine to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve now: But remember, O ſoule, former doubtings ſhall be remembred no more, if thou beleeve now.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee, there is no ground to hinder faith, there is neither inhibition by God, nor is there any warrant in thee why thou ſhouldeſt not beleeve; neither the depth of thy dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the degree of thy defilement, nor all thy former doubtings ſhall hinder Chriſt from helping; why ſhould they then hinder thee from beleeving?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the Promiſes are made to the loweſt ſtate; ſoules in the deepeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection are directly under the Promiſe: now if the Promiſes are thine, made to thee, and to ſuch as thee, why ſhouldeſt thou not beleeve?

And though thou ſit in the darke, yet thou ſhalt ſee light (as <hi>Micha,</hi> 7.9.) yea and light is ſowen for thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. It may be thou ſeeſt it not, yet it lyes ſowne as ſeed, and wil ſpring up again. The Lord wil create peace for thee that art farre off from it, <hi>Eſa</hi> 57.17. Search the rich ſtore-houſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and thou wilt ſee moſt of them pointing out their finger to thee. Why ſayeſt thou, God hath forgotten thee? <hi>Can a Mother forget her children? yea though ſhe can, God will not forget thee,</hi> Eſa. 49.15. Say not, <hi>Thy way is hid from thy God, for he giveth power to the FAINT, and to them that have NO MIGHT he increaſeth ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 40.29:</p>
               <p>Thus all the Promiſes ſpeake to thee; O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, beleeve ſaith every Promiſe, for my ſake, and for my ſake, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hadſt thou but a peradventure, it were ground to hang upon, and it were enough to keep thee from ſinking; There is a peradventure for the vileſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. But thou haſt more then a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure of healing; for it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>I will heale back-ſlidings</hi> (marke it BACK-SLIDINGS, <hi>and I will love freely,</hi> Hoſ. 14.4. up therefore (O caſt downe ſoule) act thy faith, beleeve; Chriſt can, yea and wil help thee, raiſe thee, and thou <hi>ſhalt praiſe him, as the health of thy countenance, and as thy God.</hi>

               <p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:120075:142"/>that am thus low, and ſo vile, that have no might, and ſee no means. It is meer preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in me to beleeve, I ſhould preſume if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Say not ſo, O ſoule! Preſumption is not ſimply in caſe of Salvation, but in caſe of ſinning; Indeed, if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, I ſhall be ſaved, and therefore I may ſinne, this were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; but to ſay, I have ſinned, yet I ſhall be ſaved, this is FAITH: Thou art wrath though we have ſinned, in them is continuance, and we ſhall be ſaved, as it is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. This Scripture is a very precious place, in which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is held forth, and laid hold upon by faith, notwithſtanding the <hi>Sinners wickedneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Gods wrath. De Dieu</hi> tranſlates the whole verſe thus, <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth, and doth</hi> (i.e. who <hi>with</hi> joy doth) <hi>righteouſneſſe, by thy wayes they remember thee; If thou wert angry when we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> or (by way of queſtion) <hi>Behold, thou wert angry when we ſinned, yet in them</hi> (i. e. in thy wayes) <hi>is eternity, that we might be ſaved.</hi> The whole place indeed is a ſweet, and ſtrong ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>port to faith notwithſtanding ſins; the meaning of which (according to that Commentator) is <hi>The wayes of God are not changed, but are fo ever the ſame, and therefore what grace and bounty he hath uſed to ſhew, the ſame he ſtill will uſe to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners, that we might be ſaved.</hi> Indeed this is a good and ſweet interpretation of this place, but I think there is another interpretation as cleare, if not more comfortable, that is, if by <hi>(in them)</hi> we underſtand our ſins. Thus, <hi>wee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120075:143"/>have ſinned, and in them</hi> (i. e. our ſins <hi>is</hi>) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> (for alas, we continue ſtill ſinfull after Gods wrath for them) and (yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this) <hi>we ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and thus <hi>Calvin</hi> ſweetly gloſſeth it, <hi>Although we have been obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in our ſins</hi> (for ſin after wrath or chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is obſtinacy) <hi>and ſo deſerved to be deſtroyed a hundred times, yet through thy mercy we are ſtill ſaved.</hi> See Soule! here is mercy for <hi>obstinate ſinners,</hi> and conſider, did not Chriſt come into the world <hi>to ſave ſinners;</hi> and did not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>of which I am chiefe?</hi> This (O ſoule) is <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Chriſt came indeed to ſave ſinners, and for thee</hi> to ſay, <hi>I am chiefe</hi> (or principall) <hi>ſinner, yet ile goe too, and rely upon Christ for ſalvation,</hi> it is not <hi>preſumption but faith.</hi> O therefore, doe not thinke, and ſay, <hi>it is preſumption for thee to beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, <hi>It is preſumption to expect cure or comfort in the uſe of unlawfull meanes, or in the neglect of appointed meanes;</hi> But faith is ſo farre from being an unlawfull meanes, that it is the only appointed meanes. Thou readeſt, and prayeſt, and heareſt, &amp;c. And now thou art cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to beleeve, and calleſt thou this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption? Thou art very much miſtaken (O ſoule) Beſides, it cannot be preſumption to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey a command; Chriſt commands us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve (as was ſhewed) he forbids our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting, and caſtings down, and he requires us to beleeve in his Father, and in him. Now calleſt thou obedience preſumption, beware of that: O ſoule!</p>

               <p>Doth the child that is ſad, and heavy, and abſtaines from meate, and lyes upon the ground, doth this childe preſume, when upon his fathers command hee ariſeth, and eates, and is merry? Did the Prodigall preſume, when his father ſaid, let us eate and be merry? Admit thy ſelfe to be the Prodigall (O ſoule!) yet ſith Chriſt bids thee ariſe, and eate, and be merry, why ſhouldeſt thou thinke this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption;</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But Chriſt commands not me: he ſpeaks not ſo to me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, not to thee O ſoule? I ſay why not to thee? Is thy ſoule excluded, when none is. Doth not Chriſt call any, every thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoule? ſaith he not, if ANY <hi>thirſt let him come?</hi> Called he not Publicans, Harlots, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Perſecutours; yea, did he not aſcend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive gifts for Rebels, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 68.18. why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (O ſoule!) doſt ſay Chriſt calleth not thee?</p>
               <p>I witneſſe in Chriſts name (and let this ſtand in Print as a proofe) that I as an Embaſſadour of Chriſt ſpeak to you, and in his name I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, to accept of grace, and reconciliation freely. Thou even thou (O dejected ſoule!) art the man and woman, that Chriſt cals upon to beleeve: Thou who art dejected and in the dark, and ſeeſt no light. Chriſt ſaith to thee beleeve; ſo <hi>ſhalt thou be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Now doe not ſay that this is preſumption.</p>
               <p>Once againe (becauſe I find ſoules harping upon this ſtring) Thou ſayeſt I ſhall preſume
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:120075:144"/>if I beleeve, <hi>let me grant it, yet tis but periſhing by preſumption; and ſo thou muſt certainly except thou beleeve.</hi> I remember how the leprous men ſpake one to another. <hi>Why ſit we here untill we dye, if we ſay we will enter into the City, we ſhall dye there, and if we ſit ſtill here, wee dye alſo. Come let us go to the Hoaſt, if they ſave us alive, we ſhall live; and if they kill us, we ſhall but dye,</hi> 2 Kings 7.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</p>
               <p>Reaſon thou ſo (O ſoul!) If I ſit ſtill in my dejected ſtate, and diſpaire, I ſhall dye; and if I do act faith, and beleeve, I can but dye. Therefore Ile up and beleeve; yea, though Chriſt ſhould kill mee, Ile beleeve: If I muſt periſh, Ile periſh in a way of beleeving. Say therefore to thy ſoule (as <hi>David</hi> did) <hi>why art caſt down O my ſoul? and why art thou diſquieted?</hi> Waite on God; beleeve in Chriſt. If I muſt periſh, Ile periſh truſting in him, that I ſhall praiſe him.</p>
               <p>But know O ſoule! If thou doe beleeve thou ſhalt ſee Chriſts glory; Thou ſhalt ſee the glory of his power, in helping the weakeſt; and the glory of his grace in doing for the worſt. And when thou ſeeſt this, thou <hi>ſhalt praiſe him as thy God.</hi> Wherefore then to wind up all, remember though thou be low, and ſee little, yet doe not diſpaire. Although thy eyes have failed with looking, and thy heart with longing; Although thy ſtrength bee gone, and thou be now ready to dye, yet do not diſpaire: But in thy loweſt ebbe of dejection, when thou art diſquieted, and caſt down moſt, act thy faith,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:120075:144"/>and ſay, <hi>Though I bee low, I may riſe; Yea, though I bee caſt downe, I ſhall bee raiſed; When I am in the deepeſt dejection, and cannot mount up my ſelfe: Then ſhall Chriſts power be manifeſted, and magnified in my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> And I <hi>ſhall after all my ſighs, and groanes, yet ſing prayſe unto God, as the health of my countenance and my God.</hi> Surely, this is thy duty to endeavour, and 'twill be thy glory to performe.</p>
